When a deposition transcript lands in your inbox, you already know what’s ahead: hours of scrolling, annotating, and cross-checking citations. Eighty pages can feel endless when every statement could shape causation, damages, or witness credibility.

For most litigation teams, reviewing one transcript takes **three to four hours**: a paralegal reads line by line, an associate verifies citations, and both race against filing deadlines.

It’s essential work, but also **the most repetitive, time-consuming part of case preparation.**

So we put it to the test: the same 80-page deposition, summarized manually versus summarized by **Dodon.ai’s automated deposition summary software**.

Here’s what we found.

## **Manual Review: The Baseline**

**Time Spent:** 3 hours 47 minutes  
**Team:** 1 paralegal + 1 associate (for QA)  
**Output:** 8-page summary with citations

**Typical pain points:**

-   Switching constantly between PDF viewers and Word documents  
    
-   Manually inserting and verifying every page-line citation  
    
-   Missing key details on the first pass, forcing a second review  
    
-   Total cost: ≈ **$250** in billable time per transcript  
    

The result? Accurate, yes: but slow, draining, and impossible to scale.

## **Dodon.ai Review: 80 Pages in Seconds**

With Dodon.ai, the same transcript was uploaded **as-is** - no pre-formatting or document splitting required.

## **Why Accuracy Still Matters**

Speed alone doesn’t win cases. Deposition summaries are for **litigation preparation and discovery**, not courtroom filings.

Every summary must trace back to the **original record** to hold up under scrutiny.

That’s why Dodon.ai includes **page-line citations and direct source references in every output**, giving your team transparency and auditability by default.

## **The Takeaway**

Manual review ensures accuracy, but it kills momentum.

Dodon.ai delivers the same professional standard **in minutes instead of hours**, freeing legal teams to spend more time on strategy and client work.

## **From Hours to Seconds Without Losing the Facts That Matter**

Every deposition summary should make the record clearer, not longer. The challenge has always been balancing **speed and accuracy**, but with automated legal summaries, that balance has shifted.

Dodon.ai doesn’t replace professional judgment but it accelerates it.The software surfaces citations, organizes testimony, and flags providers automatically, so attorneys can focus on what actually wins cases: **analysis, not transcription.**

If your team still spends hours summarizing depositions manually, it’s time to see what’s possible.
