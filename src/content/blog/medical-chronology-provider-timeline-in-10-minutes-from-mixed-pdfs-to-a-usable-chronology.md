When records arrive as mixed PDFs - scans, portal printouts, imaging notes - building a clean [medical chronology](/ai-medical-record-summaries-chronologies/) fast is the difference between spinning wheels and moving a case forward. A usable timeline, for our purposes, is a concise sequence of dates, providers, diagnoses/treatments, and key events that links back to the exact page you’ll cite later in discovery responses, demand packages, or expert memos. It’s not courtroom evidence - it’s **litigation prep you can trust** because every entry traces back to the original page.**‍**

## The fastest path: from upload to timeline you can check in under 10 minutes

### **1) Start inside a Matter**

Create or open the Matter that holds the records for a single case. Keeping all uploads scoped to the Matter keeps exports and handoffs tidy later.

**Insider cue:** If the records are still trickling in, tag each batch with the date received and the provider name so you can search by source later.

### **2) Upload the provider PDFs (no reformatting)**

Drop in whatever you have: office notes, hospital summaries, lab reports, imaging reads, discharge papers—even messy scans. The software reads **text, handwriting, and images** out of the box, so you don’t have to re-scan or re-label first.

**Tip for cleaner input later:** As you skim the first batch, note any **other providers referenced** (consults, imaging centers). Add them to your records-request list so the next chronology pass doesn’t miss dates or gaps.

### **3) Click Summarize → Medical Record**

Choose **Medical Record** as the summary type. Dodon.ai presents a first-pass chronology of visits, procedures, meds, and salient findings—organized by date and provider—so you can assess treatment arcs and gaps quickly.

**What to look for now (60–90 seconds):**

-   Are the **date anchors** (admission, surgery, discharge) in place?  
    
-   Any **unexplained gaps** in care worth flagging for follow-up requests?  
    
-   Do diagnoses and treatments align with the alleged mechanism of injury?

### **4) Verify on the source page (make it a 60-second reflex)**

Click any event to open the **cited page**. Spot-check the exact line, figure, or date; add a quick tag (e.g., _causation_, _credibility_, _damages_) if it’s important; move on. This tight loop keeps the team confident that every note maps back to the record without retyping long quotes in chat.

**Pro move for paralegals:** When you see a clinical term that will recur (e.g., _radiculopathy_), add a short glossary note in your Matter so junior staff and outside experts stay aligned on language.

### **5) Export and circulate**

When your first pass looks solid, export the chronology in your team’s working format:

-   **DOCX** for attorney edits in track-changes  
    
-   **PDF** for adjusters or experts who prefer a fixed layout  
    
-   **TXT** for simple pasting into case notes or templates  
    

Every format retains **page-linked citations**, so a partner can open an entry and land on the exact page later.

### **What this solves (vs. doing it by hand)**

-   **Time:** Turns hours of sorting and skimming into minutes of review.  
    
-   **Consistency:** Uniform event rows and provider labeling, so different staffers stop inventing new formats.  
    
-   **Traceability:** Every fact ties back to the source page, reducing rework and “where did this come from?” loops.  
    
-   **Handoff-ready:** Clean exports slot into demand packages, defense chronologies, or expert outlines without re-typing.  
    

### **Good chronology habits that compound**

-   **Begin with the Records Request in mind.** As you verify entries, capture missing providers or ranges and feed them back into requests.  
    
-   **Tag with intent.** Light labels like _causation_, _mechanism_, _pre-existing_, _gap_, _billing_ make later searching faster than keyword hunts.  
    
-   **Keep quotes short.** Capture the fact and the page, not paragraphs. Long quotes belong in briefs, not in working chronologies.  
    
-   **Version lightly.** Save “First pass – {date}” before major edits so attorneys can compare across drafts.  
    

## **FAQs**

**Is this “court-ready”?** No. Think of it as **litigation-prep** output with page-linked citations for easy verification and reuse.

‍**Will it work on messy scans?** Yes - mixed PDFs are expected; the software reads text, handwriting, and images without special formatting.

**Can I filter by provider or issue?** Yes; search and filter your chronology to zero in on body systems, providers, or event types before exporting.
