Dodonai's Document Summary Table automates creation of a summary table from any set of documents.

‍

1\. Upload the documents from the file or as zip file. Dodonai automatically extracts attachments from .eml files.

2\. Dodonai processes each document and creates a summary table available for download in .pdf or .doc format.

3\. The table includes the filename, date, document type, pre-filled description, summary, any email addresses referenced, and a page count for each document.

If you have further questions about your case, you can ask the documents using Dodonai's chat with your documents feature.
