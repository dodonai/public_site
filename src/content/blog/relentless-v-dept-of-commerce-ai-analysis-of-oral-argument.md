### OPENINGS

Attorney Martinez, representing the petitioners, argues that the Chevron doctrine, which allows courts to defer to agencies' interpretations of ambiguous statutes, should be overruled. He contends that Chevron violates the Constitution by reallocating interpretive authority from courts to agencies, undermining judges' duty to interpret federal statutes independently. He also argues that Chevron violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which he believes requires de novo review of legal questions. Martinez further criticizes the implied delegation theory, which justifies Chevron, as a fiction. He concludes by stating that if the petitioners have the best view of the statute, they should win the case.

In her rebuttal, General Prelogar, representing the respondents, defends the Chevron framework as a foundational principle of administrative law with deep roots in the Court's jurisprudence. She argues that overruling such a precedent would require an extraordinary justification, which she believes the petitioners lack. Prelogar contends that the petitioners' arguments are inconsistent with historical precedent and the APA. She also highlights the significant reliance interests at stake, noting that Congress, agencies, states, regulated parties, and the public have all relied on Chevron and the regulations upheld under it. Prelogar concludes by warning that overruling Chevron would introduce significant instability into many areas of law.

### THOMAS

1. Justice Thomas takes interest in the following issues:
   - The tension between judicial deference and the judicial role.
   - The determination of how much deference is too much.
   - The distinction between different types of deference, such as Chevron deference and Skidmore deference.
   - The possibility of Congress requiring deference in statutory interpretation and constitutional issues.
   - The distinction between de novo review and deferential review.

2. Summary of Justice Thomas's questions and the attorneys' responses:
   - To Mr. Martinez, Justice Thomas asked about the tension between deference and the judicial role, and how to determine when deference becomes excessive. Mr. Martinez responded that deference becomes problematic when it requires a judge to interpret the law contrary to their understanding, and that Skidmore deference, which does not require this, is acceptable.
   - To General Prelogar, Justice Thomas asked whether Congress could require deference in constitutional issues. General Prelogar responded that this would raise distinct issues due to the lack of a history of courts deferring to agencies on constitutional interpretation. She also argued that deference in statutory interpretation has a long history and is not a new concept.

3. Analysis of Justice Thomas's sentiment towards each issue:
   - Justice Thomas appears skeptical about the concept of deference, particularly when it conflicts with a judge's interpretation of the law. He seems to be seeking a clear line of when deference becomes excessive.
   - He also seems to question the idea of Congress requiring deference in constitutional issues, suggesting a belief in the importance of judicial independence in these matters.

4. Analysis of Justice Thomas's sentiment towards each party's position:
   - Justice Thomas appears to be somewhat sympathetic to Mr. Martinez's argument that deference becomes problematic when it conflicts with a judge's interpretation of the law.
   - He seems less convinced by General Prelogar's argument that deference in statutory interpretation has a long history, questioning the comparison to mandamus and other extraordinary writs.

2. Summary of Justice Roberts' questions and the attorneys' responses:
   - To Mr. Martinez, Justice Roberts asked about the interpretation of the term "reasonable" in a statute and whether it's a legal question for the court or a policy question for the agency. Mr. Martinez responded that the term confers discretion to the agency but there are limits that the court has to police.
   - Justice Roberts also asked about the interpretation of "interstate commerce" in a statute. Mr. Martinez responded that it would be a classic legal question for the court.
   - To General Prelogar, Justice Roberts asked about the relationship between Section 706 of the APA and the Chevron doctrine. General Prelogar responded that there's no fundamental incompatibility between the two.
   - Justice Roberts also asked about the frequency of cases where the interpretation of statutes comes into question. Both attorneys agreed that it comes up often.

3. Analysis of Justice Roberts' sentiment towards each issue:
   - Justice Roberts seems to be interested in understanding the boundaries between the court's role and the agency's role in interpreting statutes. He seems to lean towards the idea that the court should have a significant role in interpreting legal terms in statutes.
   - He also seems to be skeptical about the frequency of cases where the interpretation of statutes comes into question, suggesting that it may not be as common as the attorneys suggest.
   - Regarding the Chevron doctrine, Justice Roberts seems to question its relevance and application in recent years.

   - The potential for Congress to codify Chevron deference.

2. Summary of Justice Kagan's questions and the attorneys' responses:
   - To Mr. Martinez, Justice Kagan posed hypothetical questions about the interpretation of statutory terms, such as whether a product promoting healthy cholesterol levels is a dietary supplement or a drug. Mr. Martinez responded that it would depend on the original understanding of the statute and that it's a legal question for a court. Justice Kagan questioned whether courts should make such determinations without deferring to agencies, especially when the text of the statute is unclear. Mr. Martinez argued that courts should use traditional tools of construction to interpret the law, even in difficult cases.
   - Justice Kagan also asked Mr. Martinez about the potential for Congress to codify Chevron deference. Mr. Martinez argued that Congress could not do so because it would reallocate interpretive authority from the courts to agencies.
   - To General Prelogar, Justice Kagan asked about the variability in the alternative scenario without Chevron deference. General Prelogar agreed that without Chevron, there would likely be different interpretations among the 800 district court judges, leading to potential problems with uniformity and political accountability.

3. Analysis of Justice Kagan's sentiment towards each issue:
   - Justice Kagan appears to favor the concept of Chevron deference, arguing that it allows for uniformity and expertise in the interpretation of ambiguous statutes. She seems to believe that agencies, rather than courts, are better equipped to handle complex, policy-laden questions.

   - Justice Jackson further questions Mr. Martinez on the practical implications of his argument, asking how agencies would operate under his interpretation. Mr. Martinez argues that agencies should try to figure out what the law means and act accordingly, and if someone challenges that, it will get sorted out by the courts.
   - To General Prelogar, Justice Jackson asks about the potential for courts to overstep their boundaries and become policymakers. General Prelogar agrees that this is a valid concern and argues that Chevron helps to prevent this by allowing agencies to fill gaps in statutes when Congress has not provided a clear answer.
