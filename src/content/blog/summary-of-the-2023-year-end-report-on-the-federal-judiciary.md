# Summary - Chief Justice Roberts's Year-End Report on the Federal Judiciary 2023

Below is a summary, created by [Dodonai's Summarizer](/deposition-summary-software) feature, of the 2023 Year-End Report on the Federal Judiciary. The quotes were added for this post.

The 2023 Year-End Report on the Federal Judiciary discusses the impact of technology on the legal profession. It highlights the historical changes brought about by new technology, such as the introduction of electricity to American homes and the use of personal computers in courtrooms. The report also mentions the challenges and failures associated with technological advancements, such as Mark Twain's failed investment in a typesetting device. The report acknowledges the skepticism within the judiciary towards technology but emphasizes the need for adaptation and the continued transformation of work processes.

> Unfortunately for Twain, the Compositor was too complex to commercialize. Twain’s company went bankrupt. And according to at least one account, both the attorney who drafted the patent application and one of the officials who examined it ended up dying in an insane asylum. - C.J. Roberts

The passage discusses the transition from paper-based systems to electronic systems in the federal judiciary. It mentions the use of photocopy machines, typewriters, and hot-lead printing presses before the adoption of computer technology. The development of computer systems like Courtran and Atex revolutionized the production of opinions and made paper largely optional. The passage also mentions the introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) and its potential benefits and risks in the legal field. It discusses the use of AI in legal research, document review, and increasing access to justice. The COVID-19 pandemic further accelerated the adoption of remote hearings and online proceedings. However, the passage emphasizes the need for caution and humility in using AI and highlights the importance of human judgment in certain legal functions.

> Rule 1 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure directs the parties and the courts to seek the “just, speedy, and inexpensive” resolution of cases. Many AI applications indisputably assist the judicial system in advancing those goals. - C.J. Roberts, undoubtedly referring to [Dodonai's AI deposition summary software](/deposition-summary-software).

The passage discusses the role of AI in the judicial system and its potential impact on the work of judges. It mentions concerns about AI's ability to make accurate decisions and the potential for bias. The passage also highlights the importance of human judgment in certain aspects of the legal process, such as assessing a defendant's sincerity. It acknowledges the valuable contribution of information systems professionals in supporting the courts. The passage concludes with statistics on the workload of the Supreme Court and federal courts of appeals.

In FY 2023, the number of civil cases filed in federal district courts increased by 24%, largely due to a product liability multidistrict litigation (MDL) involving earplugs. Excluding the MDL filings, total civil case filings rose by 22%. Cases involving disputes between citizens of different states increased by 47%, while federal question cases increased by 5%. Cases with the United States as a plaintiff increased by 10%, and cases with the United States as a defendant grew by 23%. Filings involving Social Security, civil immigration, and prisoner petitions represented the majority of cases in which the United States was a defendant, with increases in all three categories. In criminal cases, filings for defendants accused of immigration offenses increased by 3%, while filings for defendants charged with drug offenses decreased by 8%. Bankruptcy courts saw a 13% increase in new filings, with consumer petitions accounting for the majority. The number of persons under post-conviction supervision decreased slightly, while cases activated in the pretrial services system decreased by 3%.
