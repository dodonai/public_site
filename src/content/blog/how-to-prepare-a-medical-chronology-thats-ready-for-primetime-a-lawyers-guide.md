In [personal injury](/practice-areas/personal-injury/), [malpractice](/practice-areas/medical-malpractice/), and insurance defense, the strength of your case often hinges on a single question: **_can you clearly prove the timeline?_**

A **medical chronology** gives attorneys, insurers, and medical experts a clear, reliable roadmap of a patient’s care. It compiles records into a clear sequence of events, helping teams spot gaps, inconsistencies, and key turning points. Ultimately, a good “[med chron](/blog/understanding-medical-chronology-clear-actionable-timelines)” aids a litigation team in constructing a case for or against a plaintiff’s claim to damages.

Traditionally, building chronologies is slow, manual, and error-prone. This guide walks you through the process and shows how document automation software can dramatically simplify each step, speeding up and improving **discovery** so your team has reliable timelines ready when it matters most.

## **Step 1: Gather All Relevant Records**

Every chronology begins with the “Medical Records Request,” typically a written request to each of the healthcare providers that serviced the subject. The records may include:

-   Hospital records, physician notes, and discharge summaries
-   Lab reports, imaging, and prescriptions
-   ER visits, surgeries, and follow-ups

‍**Pro Tip:** Incomplete records = incomplete chronology. Ask for full disclosures early to avoid gaps. When reviewing records, keep an eye out for other providers mentioned that were not part of those disclosures. A good [medical chronology software](/ai-medical-record-summaries-chronologies/) like Dodon.ai will automatically flag such providers.

 👉 **Note:** Requesting medical records often involves regulated processes that vary by state. Many firms specialize in this. Be aware of those constraints when planning timelines. 

**With Dodon.ai:** Instead of manually sorting scans or mixed PDFs, upload entire files. Our technology processes text, handwriting, images, and messy PDFs out of the box without requiring extra formatting.

## **Step 2: Organize for Review**

Raw records often arrive as unstructured PDFs, scans, or EMR exports. Before building your chronology:

-   Remove duplicates
-   Ensure pages are in order
-   Label files by provider and date range

This upfront prep ensures nothing critical gets lost.

**With Dodon.ai:** _Dodon.ai does all of “Step 2”._ Bulk uploads and OCR extraction are automated, so the platform effectively handles these prep steps for you.

## **Step 3: Extract the Timeline**

Once files are organized, the core work begins: converting records into a structured timeline. This usually means:

-   Extracting dates, events, and treatments
-   Summarizing diagnoses and physician notes
-   Highlighting key incidents tied to claims
-   Citations to the original record**‍**

**With Dodon.ai:** The software identifies dates, procedures, and providers, presenting you with a ready-to-review chronology that can be exported for collaboration or client prep.

## **Step 4: Analyze for Case Strategy**

A chronology isn’t just a list of events; it’s a lens into case strengths and weaknesses. Attorneys and experts use it to:

-   Spot gaps in treatment or unexplained delays
-   Pinpoint causation links between incidents and outcomes
-   Align medical facts with the legal theory of the case**‍**

**With Dodon.ai:** Instead of flipping through hundreds of pages, you can search and filter chronologies instantly - by provider, date, or event type - making strategic analysis faster.

## **Step 5: Share With the Team**

Finally, chronologies should be easy to share with partners, clients, or experts. Formats may include:

-   Summaries or PDFs for insurers or adjusters
-   Editable timelines for attorneys and paralegals
-   Highlighted reports for medical experts**‍**

**With Dodon.ai:** Export timelines directly in shareable formats without hours of manual rework.
