### **Two formats, one purpose**

When you’re buried in stacks of medical records, the real question isn’t whether you need a summary; it’s what _format_ makes the review usable. Attorneys, paralegals, and IME doctors all rely on [**medical chronologies**](/ai-medical-record-summaries-chronologies/) to turn raw records into something manageable.

There are two main formats:

-   A **table chronology** – the summarized version of the records, laid out in a table.  
    
-   A **narrative chronology** – the same sequence of events, written in paragraph form.

Dodon.ai Matters

Both capture the same facts; the difference is how they’re presented and who uses them.

‍

## **Table chronology**

A table chronology extracts and organizes the essentials—dates, treatments, diagnoses, and providers—into a clean, fact-driven table. It’s designed for quick reference and connects directly back to the source documents.

Attorneys and litigation teams use this format to:

-   Pinpoint gaps, overlaps, or unexplained delays  
    
-   Align care events with claimed damages  
    
-   Keep citations handy for discovery and strategy  
    

**With Dodon.ai:** Upload your records once and get a ready-to-review table with page-line citations included.

Table Chronology

‍

## **Narrative chronology**

A narrative chronology covers the same ground but tells the story in paragraph form. Typically this format resembles a Review of Records document that most Independent Medical Examiners currently create manually. In some cases, rules or client requirements even mandate a narrative report.

Physicians and reviewers rely on narratives to:

-   Deliver work product in the format they’re expected to submit  
    
-   Read through the patient’s medical journey without flipping between tables  
    
-   Keep the context intact when preparing formal opinions  
    

**With Dodon.ai:** The same upload can present a flowing narrative, accurate and shareable, in minutes.

Narrative Chronology

‍

## **When you need both**

Different roles often need different outputs. Attorneys lean on the table version for clarity and citations, while doctors or insurers may require a narrative format as part of the official record. Some cases demand both in the same workflow.

**With Dodon.ai, you don’t have to choose.** Upload once and generate both formats automatically with customization to fit your particular need.

-   **Secure.** HIPAA-compliant by default, with no data used for training.  
    

## **Final word**
