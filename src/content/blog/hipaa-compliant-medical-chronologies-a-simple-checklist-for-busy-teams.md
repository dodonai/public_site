When litigation or independent medical exams depend on medical records, a single misstep can throw your strategy off course. HIPAA compliance isn’t optional, it’s the foundation that keeps patient data secure and your preparation defensible.

Here’s a practical checklist of essential do’s and critical don’ts to ensure every chronology meets HIPAA standards, plus how Dodon.ai builds compliance in from day one.

## **The Must-Do Checklist**

**1\. Identify PHI clearly  
**Protected Health Information (PHI) includes names, birthdates, medical record numbers, contact information, diagnoses, treatments, and billing details. Every chronology should flag and handle PHI with appropriate care.

**2\. Apply the “minimum necessary” rule  
**Extract only the information required for the task, nothing extra. For instance, a damages chronology doesn’t need unrelated laboratory history.

**3\. Control access strictly  
**Limit files and chronologies to authorized personnel only, using secure logins and role-based permissions. No shared Dropbox links, no unprotected email attachments.

**4\. Encrypt everything  
**HIPAA mandates encrypted storage and transmission without exception. If your data isn’t encrypted, it isn’t compliant.

**5\. Keep detailed audit trails  
**Document who accessed which records, when, and why. Logs are your first line of defense during an audit.

**6\. Respect patient rights  
**Have clear procedures for handling access or amendment requests. Delays can quickly turn into compliance failures.

**7\. Train your team thoroughly  
**Everyone handling chronologies, paralegals, associates, or IME administrators, needs training on proper handling of both digital and paper files.

**8\. Audit regularly  
**Review workflows for compliance gaps before regulators find them. Internal audits should be routine, not reactive.

## **HIPAA Don’ts for Chronologies**

-   **Don’t disclose beyond consent.** Never share PHI unless specifically authorized.  
      
    
-   **Don’t use unsecured personal devices.** Phones and laptops must meet HIPAA standards before handling patient data.  
      
    
-   **Don’t keep unencrypted copies.** Even a single PDF saved locally can be a violation.  
      
    
-   **Don’t ignore potential incidents.** Suspected breaches must be reported, documented, and addressed immediately.  
      
    
-   **Don’t skip access documentation.** Missing logs can be as damaging as an actual breach.

## **Where Dodon.ai Fits In**

Document automation doesn’t remove your compliance responsibilities, but it eliminates many common risks.

-   **Encrypted by default**: Every upload and output maintains HIPAA-level security.

-   **Audit-ready outputs**: Page-line citations and logs make every chronology defensible in compliance reviews.  
      
    
-   **Ready to use**: Upload text, handwriting, or scanned documents, and receive a structured [medical chronology](/ai-medical-record-summaries-chronologies/) in minutes.

## **The Bottom Line**

A well-built medical chronology should accelerate litigation preparation, not create compliance headaches. HIPAA is a checklist you can master, and with the right technology, it can run quietly in the background while your team focuses on strategy.
