### **ROBERTS**

**1\. The Justice takes interest in the following issues:  
**  - The interpretation of the Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause and its application to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment.  
  - The distinction between a substantive right and a cause of action.  
  - The procedural aspects of the case, including the removal of the case to federal court and the potential for a state to cease a taking after the fact.  
  - The role of the state and federal courts in enforcing the Takings Clause.

**2\. Summary of the Justice's questions and the attorneys' responses:  
**  - To Mr. McNamara (for the petitioners), the Justice asked about the potential for a state to cease a taking after it has been determined to be a taking and the state has been ordered to pay compensation. Mr. McNamara responded that a state could cease a taking, but that would create an uncompensated temporary taking.  
  - To Mr. Nielson (for the respondent), the Justice asked about the interpretation of previous Supreme Court cases that stated the Constitution provides a basis for a court to award money damages against the government. Mr. Nielson argued that these cases were about the substantive right, not a cause of action.  
  - To Mr. Kneedler (for the United States, as amicus curiae), the Justice asked about the government's argument in First English that the Constitution does not of its own force furnish a basis for a court to award money damages against the government. Mr. Kneedler argued that the Constitution speaks in terms of compensation in defining the right, not in providing a cause of action.
