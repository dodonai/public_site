When litigation turns into a document marathon, paralegals often carry the weight through long nights, endless PDFs, and the constant risk of missing a detail that could decide a case. Burnout slows settlement prep and drives up costs.

A medical chronology should be a tool for clarity, not exhaustion. At its core, it’s a structured timeline of a patient’s care, compiled from records to show diagnoses, treatments, and key turning points. Ultimately, a good “med chron” aids a litigation team in constructing a case for or against a plaintiff’s claim to damages. Every chronology begins with the **Medical Records Request**, the formal step of gathering provider records before any analysis can begin.

## **Case Example 1: The Manual Grind**

Take a mid-size personal injury firm reviewing 3,000 pages a month. A single chronology can consume **6–8 paralegal hours**, especially when duplicates and out-of-order pages pile up. Multiply that across multiple cases, and weeks of billable potential vanish into formatting, cross-referencing, and corrections.

## **Case Example 2: The Efficient Alternative**

Now compare with a team using document automation software. Instead of slogging through every scan, they bulk-upload files, receive a chronology with citations to original records in minutes, and spend their time analyzing gaps in care or causation links. Paralegal hours drop by half, settlement prep accelerates, and stress levels decline.

## **The ROI Benchmark**

Firms report saving **3–6 hours per chronology**, freeing staff for higher-value tasks. Reduced late-night review means fewer errors from fatigue. Attorneys move from record review to case strategy days sooner, helping settlements progress faster.
