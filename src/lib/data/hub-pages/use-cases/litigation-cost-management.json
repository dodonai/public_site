        "The largest share of litigation costs goes to people reading documents. Paralegals spending days building medical chronologies. Associates drafting deposition summaries. Contract reviewers working through discovery page by page. The manual approach scales linearly: twice the documents means twice the cost. Outsourcing just shifts the expense to nurse reviewers and summary services charging $5 to $25 per page.",
        "AI-powered document processing breaks this cost curve. Dodonai processes documents at a fixed cost per page, delivering structured outputs in minutes. A 300-page {{link:/deposition-summary-software/|deposition summary}} that costs $1,500-$7,500 from a vendor costs under $10 with Dodonai. A 500-page {{link:/ai-medical-record-summaries-chronologies/|medical chronology}} that takes a paralegal two full days costs under $15. These per-case savings compound across a firm's entire caseload to reduce litigation document costs substantially.",
        "The quality holds up. Dodonai's AI outputs include page citations so you can verify against the source document. The work product is on par with a skilled human reviewer, but the cost and turnaround aren't in the same universe. Firms that adopt AI document processing gain an edge that compounds across every case, with better margins on contingency and more competitive billing on hourly matters."

    {
      "question": "How much can a law firm realistically save by using Dodonai?",
      "answer": "It depends on your volume and current costs. A firm outsourcing 10 deposition summaries monthly at $3,000 each spends $30,000. With Dodonai's Pro plan at $100/month, that same work costs a fraction. Most firms see ROI on their first case."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does lower cost mean lower quality?",
      "answer": "No. Every output includes page-line references for deposition summaries, source-page citations for chronologies, and document references for extractions. Quality is comparable to skilled human reviewers, with the added benefit of consistent formatting and faster turnaround."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Dodonai pricing work?",
      "answer": "Page-volume based. Lite is $30/month for 200 pages, Basic is $60/month for 1,000 pages, Pro is $100/month for 5,000 pages. One credit processes roughly one page (~400 words). Enterprise plans available for high-volume firms. See our {{link:/pricing/|pricing page}} for details."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Dodonai handle the volume of a large litigation practice?",
      "answer": "Yes. The Pro plan covers 5,000 pages monthly, enough for roughly 15-20 deposition summaries or 10 medical chronologies. Enterprise plans support custom volumes for firms processing tens of thousands of pages."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about cost savings on contingency cases specifically?",
      "answer": "Contingency firms absorb all case prep costs until resolution. Every dollar on deposition summaries and record review reduces margins. Dodonai cuts document processing costs by 90%+, directly improving profitability, especially for high-volume {{link:/practice-areas/personal-injury/|personal injury}} and {{link:/practice-areas/mass-tort/|mass tort}} practices."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Dodonai secure enough for confidential litigation documents?",
      "answer": "Lower cost, same security standard. SOC 2 Type II certified, HIPAA compliant, AES-256 encrypted. Signed BAAs on every account. No training on your documents. Retention and deletion are yours to control."
