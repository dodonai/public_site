        "Contract review is one of the most time-intensive tasks in legal practice. Whether your team is reviewing vendor agreements, lease terms, employment contracts, or settlement agreements, the work follows the same pattern: read every page, locate the key provisions, extract the relevant terms, and compile the information into a usable format. For a single contract, this might take an hour. For a portfolio of 50 or 100 agreements — during due diligence, a lease audit, or a corporate transaction — the manual approach becomes a bottleneck that delays decisions and drives up costs.",
        "Dodonai's {{link:/dodonai-extract-and-draft-agents/|Extract and Draft Agents}} automate the extraction and structuring phase of contract review. You define what data points matter — termination clauses, indemnification provisions, payment terms, renewal dates, governing law, assignment restrictions, or any other field — and the AI reads each contract to extract those specific elements. The output is a structured summary that organizes the extracted terms in a consistent format across all agreements, with source-page citations linking every data point back to the original contract language.",
        "This does not replace attorney judgment on contract risk or negotiation strategy. It eliminates the hours of manual reading required to gather the information attorneys need to make those judgments. When your team can review the key terms from 50 contracts in the time it used to take to read 5, due diligence timelines shrink, audit scope expands, and contract management becomes proactive instead of reactive."
