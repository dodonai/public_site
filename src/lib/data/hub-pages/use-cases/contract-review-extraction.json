        "Dodonai's {{link:/dodonai-extract-and-draft-agents/|Extract and Draft Agents}} automate contract extraction and the structuring phase of contract review. You define what data points matter (termination clauses, indemnification provisions, payment terms, renewal dates, governing law) and the AI reads each contract to extract those specific elements. The output is a structured summary that organizes the extracted terms consistently across all agreements, with every data point tracing to the exact source page.",
        "This doesn't replace attorney judgment on contract risk or negotiation strategy. It eliminates the hours of manual reading required to gather the information attorneys need to make those judgments. When your team can review key terms from 50 contracts in the time it used to take to read 5, due diligence timelines shrink and contract management becomes proactive instead of reactive."

      "answer": "Vendor agreements, employment contracts, leases, settlements, NDAs, service agreements, licensing deals, insurance policies, and more. The {{link:/dodonai-extract-and-draft-agents/|Extract and Draft Agents}} are configurable for any document structure, so you define what fields to extract based on the contract type."

      "question": "How accurate is AI contract extraction?",
      "answer": "Accuracy is high for well-defined data points like dates, party names, dollar amounts, and specific clause types. Every extracted term includes a page citation linking to the original contract language, so attorneys can verify any data point in seconds. We recommend a review pass, just as you would with work from any associate or vendor."

    {
      "question": "Can I build different extraction templates for different contract types?",
      "answer": "Yes. Build separate agents for lease review, vendor audits, employment agreement analysis, or any other contract type. Each agent saves its template for reuse without reconfiguring."

    {
      "question": "How does Dodonai handle scanned or image-only contract PDFs?",
      "answer": "Dodonai's {{link:/ai-pdf-ocr/|AI-powered OCR}} converts scanned contracts, faxed copies, and image-only PDFs into extractable text. Older agreements and poorly scanned documents get included in your review without manual retyping."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does contract review with Dodonai cost?",
      "answer": "Plans are based on page volume. Lite is $30/month for 200 pages, Basic is $60/month for 1,000 pages, Pro is $100/month for 5,000 pages. A 20-page contract uses 20 credits.
