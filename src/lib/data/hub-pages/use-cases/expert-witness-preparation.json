        "Expert witness depositions are among the highest-stakes events in litigation. Whether you are deposing the opposing side's retained expert to build a Daubert challenge, preparing your own expert for cross-examination, or taking testimony from a non-retained treating physician, the outcome hinges on preparation depth. You need to master the expert's methodology, map their opinions against the factual record, identify inconsistencies across prior testimony, and lock down positions that can be used at trial or in a motion to exclude under FRE 702.",
        "That preparation is document-intensive — prior deposition transcripts, Rule 26(a)(2) reports, published articles, case-specific records, and sometimes testimony from other cases where the expert reached different conclusions. AI document processing tools like Dodonai compress this timeline dramatically. Upload an expert's prior transcripts and receive {{link:/deposition-summary-software/|detailed summaries}} with page-line citations in minutes. Upload expert reports and medical records to build chronologies that map opinions against the factual record. Use {{link:/ai-deposition-transcript-software/|semantic search across transcripts}} to find every instance where the expert discussed a specific methodology, opinion, or conclusion — including passages that keyword search would miss.",
        "Attorneys arrive at the deposition with organized summaries, identified contradictions, and a clear understanding of the expert's prior positions — the foundation for effective cross-examination and, where warranted, a Daubert or Frye challenge to admissibility."

    {
      "question": "How does Dodonai help attorneys prepare for expert depositions?",
      "answer": "Dodonai processes the expert's prior deposition transcripts into page-line summaries, builds chronologies from Rule 26 reports and medical records, and enables semantic search across all uploaded documents. This gives attorneys a comprehensive view of the expert's prior testimony, opinions, and methodology — whether you are preparing cross-examination for trial, building the record for a Daubert or Frye challenge, or evaluating a rebuttal expert's positions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I search for contradictions across multiple expert depositions?",
      "answer": "Yes. Upload multiple transcripts from the same expert and use Dodonai's semantic search to find every instance where the expert discussed a specific topic. The AI searches by meaning, not just keywords, so it catches relevant passages even when the expert used different phrasing across depositions. You can compare statements side by side in the interactive viewer to identify inconsistencies."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can I get summaries of expert deposition transcripts?",
      "answer": "Dodonai processes a typical 100-page deposition transcript in approximately 3 minutes. You receive a complete {{link:/deposition-summary-software/|page-line or narrative summary}} with citations, ready for review. If you need to reprocess with different key topics or focus areas, that takes the same amount of time."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Dodonai handle expert reports and medical records alongside transcripts?",
      "answer": "Yes. You can upload Rule 26(a)(2)(B) expert reports from retained experts, summary disclosures from non-retained witnesses like treating physicians, medical records, published articles, and deposition transcripts together. Dodonai processes each document type appropriately — generating summaries for transcripts, chronologies for medical records — and makes everything searchable through the same semantic search interface."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is my case data secure when preparing for expert depositions?",
      "answer": "Dodonai is SOC 2 Type II certified and HIPAA compliant. All documents are encrypted with AES-256 in transit and at rest. Your data is never used to train AI models, and you retain full control over data retention and deletion. This applies to all document types including transcripts, expert reports, and medical records."
    },
    {
      "question": "What output formats are available for deposition preparation materials?",
      "answer": "Dodonai exports summaries, chronologies, and search results as PDF, Word, Excel, or plain text files. You can download individual summaries or compile materials for a deposition binder. Every output includes source-page citations for quick verification against the original documents."
