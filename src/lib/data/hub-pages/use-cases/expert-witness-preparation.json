        "Expert witness depositions are among the highest-stakes events in litigation. The outcome often hinges on whether the deposing attorney has done enough preparation to challenge the expert's methodology, expose inconsistencies in prior testimony, and lock down opinions that can be used at trial. That preparation is document-intensive, requiring attorneys to review prior deposition transcripts, expert reports, published articles, and case records — often running to thousands of pages.",
        "AI document processing tools like Dodonai compress this preparation timeline dramatically. Upload an expert's prior deposition transcripts and receive {{link:/deposition-summary-software/|detailed summaries}} with page-line citations in minutes. Upload expert reports and medical records to build chronologies that map the expert's opinions against the factual record. Use {{link:/ai-deposition-transcript-software/|semantic search across transcripts}} to find every instance where the expert discussed a specific methodology, opinion, or conclusion — including passages that keyword search would miss.",
        "The result is a more thorough, more efficient preparation process. Attorneys arrive at the deposition with organized summaries, identified contradictions, and a clear understanding of the expert's prior positions, all without spending days manually reading and cross-referencing documents."

      "question": "How does Dodonai help attorneys prepare for expert depositions?",
      "answer": "Dodonai processes the expert's prior deposition transcripts into page-line summaries, builds chronologies from expert reports and medical records, and enables semantic search across all uploaded documents. This gives attorneys a comprehensive, organized view of the expert's prior testimony, opinions, and methodology without spending days on manual document review."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I search for contradictions across multiple expert depositions?",
      "answer": "Yes. Upload multiple transcripts from the same expert and use Dodonai's semantic search to find every instance where the expert discussed a specific topic. The AI searches by meaning, not just keywords, so it catches relevant passages even when the expert used different phrasing across depositions. You can compare statements side by side in the interactive viewer to identify inconsistencies."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can I get summaries of expert deposition transcripts?",
      "answer": "Dodonai processes a typical 100-page deposition transcript in approximately 3 minutes. You receive a complete {{link:/deposition-summary-software/|page-line or narrative summary}} with citations, ready for review. If you need to reprocess with different key topics or focus areas, that takes the same amount of time."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Dodonai handle expert reports and medical records alongside transcripts?",
      "answer": "Yes. You can upload expert reports, medical records, published articles, and deposition transcripts together. Dodonai processes each document type appropriately — generating summaries for transcripts, chronologies for medical records, and making everything searchable through the same semantic search interface."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is my case data secure when preparing for expert depositions?",
