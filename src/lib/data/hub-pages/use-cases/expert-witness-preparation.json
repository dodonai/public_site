        "Expert witness preparation is high-stakes. Whether you're building a Daubert challenge or preparing your own expert for cross, the outcome hinges on preparation depth. You need to master the expert's methodology, map opinions against the factual record, identify inconsistencies across prior testimony, and lock down positions for trial or a motion to exclude under FRE 702.",
        "That preparation is document-intensive. It involves prior transcripts, expert witness reports filed under Rule 26(a)(2), published articles, case-specific records, and sometimes testimony from other cases where the expert reached different conclusions. AI expert deposition preparation tools like Dodonai compress this timeline from weeks to hours. Upload an expert's prior transcripts and receive {{link:/deposition-summary-software/|detailed summaries}} with page-line citations in minutes. Upload expert reports and medical records to build chronologies mapping opinions against the factual record. Use {{link:/ai-deposition-transcript-software/|semantic search across transcripts}} to find every instance where the expert discussed a methodology or conclusion, including passages keyword search would miss.",
        "Attorneys arrive at the deposition with organized summaries, identified contradictions, and a clear map of the expert's prior positions, all at a fraction of the cost of manual preparation. A 200-page expert transcript that takes 6-8 hours to digest manually is summarized in about 6 minutes."

This gives attorneys the full picture of the expert's testimony history and methodology, whether you're preparing cross, building a Daubert challenge, or evaluating a rebuttal expert."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I search for contradictions across multiple expert depositions?",
      "answer": "Yes. Upload multiple transcripts from the same expert and use semantic search to find every instance where the expert discussed a topic. The AI searches by meaning, not just keywords, catching relevant passages even when phrasing differs across depositions."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can I get summaries of expert deposition transcripts?",
      "answer": "A typical 100-page transcript processes in about 3 minutes. You receive a complete {{link:/deposition-summary-software/|page-line or narrative summary}} with citations, ready for review. Reprocessing with different focus areas takes the same amount of time."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Dodonai handle expert reports and medical records alongside transcripts?",

    {
      "question": "Is my case data secure when preparing for expert depositions?",
      "answer": "Expert deposition prep materials are attorney work product. AES-256 encryption, SOC 2 Type II certification, and signed BAAs protect every file. We don't train on your uploads. You control retention and deletion."
    },
    {
