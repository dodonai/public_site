        "The quality of a demand letter hinges on how thoroughly and clearly it presents the plaintiff's medical history, treatment timeline, and documented damages. Adjusters and defense counsel evaluate demand packages based on the specificity and organization of the supporting evidence. A demand letter backed by a detailed medical chronology with source citations carries more weight than one that relies on vague summaries or disorganized records.",
        "Dodonai accelerates every step of the demand letter preparation process. Upload your client's medical records and receive a complete {{link:/ai-medical-record-summaries-chronologies/|medical chronology}} that documents every diagnosis, treatment, provider visit, and medication change in chronological order. Upload deposition transcripts and get {{link:/deposition-summary-software/|page-line summaries}} that highlight liability admissions, damages testimony, and causation evidence. The result is a well-documented demand package assembled in hours instead of weeks.",
        "For {{link:/practice-areas/personal-injury/|personal injury firms}} handling high volumes of cases on contingency, faster demand letter preparation directly impacts revenue. Cases that sit waiting for document organization are cases that are not generating settlements. Dodonai eliminates the documentation bottleneck so your team can send demand letters sooner and resolve cases faster."

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How does AI help with demand letter preparation?",
      "answer": "AI automates the most time-consuming part of demand letter preparation: organizing and summarizing the medical evidence. Dodonai processes your client's medical records and generates a structured chronology with source citations, a narrative summary, and deposition digests. This gives you the organized documentation you need to draft a demand letter without spending days on manual record review."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Dodonai generate a demand letter for me?",
      "answer": "Dodonai does not draft the demand letter itself. What it does is produce the organized medical chronologies, summaries, and deposition digests that form the evidentiary backbone of a strong demand package. Your attorneys retain full control over the narrative, legal arguments, and settlement demand amount."
    },
    {
      "question": "What information does the medical chronology include for demand letters?",
      "answer": "The medical chronology includes dates, provider names, diagnoses, treatments, procedures, medications, and relevant clinical notes — all arranged chronologically with source-page citations. This level of detail allows you to articulate the full scope of injuries and treatment in your demand letter with specific references to the medical records."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can I prepare a demand package with Dodonai?",
      "answer": "Medical record processing typically completes in minutes, regardless of file size. A 500-page medical record set that would take a paralegal 8-12 hours to review manually is organized by Dodonai in under 15 minutes. Deposition summaries are similarly fast. This means you can have all the documentation you need to begin drafting a demand letter within hours of receiving the records."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the output accurate enough to cite in a demand letter?",
      "answer": "Yes. Every entry in the medical chronology and every statement in the deposition summary includes a source citation linking back to the specific page in the original document. This allows your attorneys to verify any data point before including it in the demand letter. We recommend a brief review of the AI output as a best practice, just as you would with work from any vendor or paralegal."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does it cost to prepare a demand package with Dodonai?",
      "answer": "Dodonai plans start at $30 per month for 200 pages of document processing. The Pro plan at $100 per month covers up to 5,000 pages, which is typically enough for multiple demand packages. Compare that to outsourced medical record review services that charge $5 to $15 per page, and the savings on even a single case are significant.
