        "Adjusters evaluate demands based on how thoroughly the medical evidence is organized. A demand backed by a detailed chronology carries more weight than a stack of unorganized records — and AI demand letter tools make that level of organization practical on every case.",
        "Dodonai accelerates every step of that process. Upload your client's medical records and receive a complete {{link:/ai-medical-record-summaries-chronologies/|medical chronology}} that documents every diagnosis, treatment, provider visit, and medication change in chronological order. Upload deposition transcripts and get {{link:/deposition-summary-software/|page-line summaries}} highlighting liability admissions, damages testimony, and causation evidence. Standard BI demand, policy limits demand, time-limit demand — the documented evidence is organized and ready for all of them.",
        "For {{link:/practice-areas/personal-injury/|personal injury firms}} handling high volumes on contingency, faster AI demand letter preparation directly impacts revenue. Every week a case sits waiting on documentation is a week without settlement movement. Dodonai cuts the documentation phase from days to minutes so your team can send demands sooner and resolve cases faster."

      "question": "How does AI help with demand letter preparation?",
      "answer": "AI handles the most time-consuming part: organizing the medical evidence. Upload records and get a structured chronology with citations, a narrative summary, and deposition digests — the documented foundation you need to draft a demand package without days of manual review."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Dodonai generate a demand letter for me?",
      "answer": "Dodonai doesn't draft the demand letter itself. It produces the organized chronologies, summaries, and deposition digests that form the evidentiary backbone. Your attorneys retain full control over the damages narrative, legal arguments, demand amount, and response deadline."
    },
    {
      "question": "What information does the medical chronology include for demand letters?",
      "answer": "Dates, provider names, diagnoses, treatments, procedures, medications, and clinical notes — all chronological with source-page citations. This lets you itemize specials with supporting documentation and articulate the full treatment arc from injury through MMI."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can I prepare a demand package with Dodonai?",
      "answer": "Medical record processing completes in minutes regardless of file size. A 500-page record set that would take a paralegal 8-12 hours is organized in under 15 minutes. You can have all the documentation you need to begin drafting within hours of receiving the records."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the output accurate enough to cite in a demand letter?",
      "answer": "Yes. Every entry in the chronology and every statement in the deposition summary includes a citation linked directly to the underlying record. Your attorneys can verify any data point before including it. We recommend a brief review pass, just as you would with any vendor's work product."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does it cost to prepare a demand package with Dodonai?",
      "answer": "Pages process for as little as $0.02 each on the Pro plan, compared to $5-$15 per page from outsourced review services. For contingency firms preparing multiple demand packages monthly, the cost difference shows up on every case. Visit our {{link:/pricing/|pricing page}} for details."
