        "The quality of a demand package hinges on how thoroughly and clearly it presents the plaintiff's medical history, documented specials, and damages narrative. Adjusters — and the claims valuation software they use — evaluate demands based on the specificity and organization of the supporting evidence. A demand backed by a detailed medical chronology with source citations, clearly itemized specials, and an organized treatment narrative from date of loss through MMI carries more weight than a stack of unorganized records and a cover letter.",
        "Dodonai accelerates every step of that process. Upload your client's medical records and receive a complete {{link:/ai-medical-record-summaries-chronologies/|medical chronology}} that documents every diagnosis, treatment, provider visit, and medication change in chronological order. Upload deposition transcripts and get {{link:/deposition-summary-software/|page-line summaries}} that highlight liability admissions, damages testimony, and causation evidence. Whether you are assembling a standard BI demand, a policy limits demand designed to create bad faith exposure, or a time-limit demand with a firm response deadline, the documented evidence is organized and ready.",
        "For {{link:/practice-areas/personal-injury/|personal injury firms}} handling high volumes of cases on contingency, faster demand preparation directly impacts revenue. Every week a case sits waiting on documentation is a week without settlement movement — and another week your firm is carrying the cost advance. Dodonai eliminates the documentation bottleneck so your team can send demands sooner and resolve cases faster."

    {
      "question": "How does AI help with demand letter preparation?",
      "answer": "AI automates the most time-consuming part of demand preparation: organizing and summarizing the medical evidence. Dodonai processes your client's medical records and generates a structured chronology with source citations, a narrative summary, and deposition digests. This gives you the organized foundation you need — documented specials, a clear treatment narrative, and highlighted testimony — to draft a demand package without spending days on manual record review."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Dodonai generate a demand letter for me?",
      "answer": "Dodonai does not draft the demand letter itself. What it does is produce the organized medical chronologies, summaries, and deposition digests that form the evidentiary backbone of a strong demand package. Your attorneys retain full control over the damages narrative, legal arguments, demand amount, and response deadline — the strategic decisions that determine whether a demand moves the case toward resolution."
    },
    {
      "question": "What information does the medical chronology include for demand letters?",
      "answer": "The medical chronology includes dates, provider names, diagnoses, treatments, procedures, medications, and relevant clinical notes — all arranged chronologically with source-page citations. This level of detail allows you to itemize specials with supporting documentation, articulate the full treatment arc from injury through MMI, and reference specific records when describing ongoing medical needs or future treatment requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can I prepare a demand package with Dodonai?",
      "answer": "Medical record processing typically completes in minutes, regardless of file size. A 500-page medical record set that would take a paralegal 8-12 hours to review manually is organized by Dodonai in under 15 minutes. Deposition summaries are similarly fast. This means you can have all the documentation you need to begin drafting a demand letter within hours of receiving the records."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the output accurate enough to cite in a demand letter?",
      "answer": "Yes. Every entry in the medical chronology and every statement in the deposition summary includes a source citation linking back to the specific page in the original document. This allows your attorneys to verify any data point before including it in the demand letter. We recommend a brief review of the AI output as a best practice, just as you would with work from any vendor or paralegal."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does it cost to prepare a demand package with Dodonai?",
      "answer": "Dodonai processes pages for as little as $0.02 each on the Pro plan. Compare that to outsourced medical record review services at $5 to $15 per page, and the savings on even a single case are significant. For contingency firms preparing multiple demand packages per month, the economics are compelling. Visit our {{link:/pricing/|pricing page}} for details."
