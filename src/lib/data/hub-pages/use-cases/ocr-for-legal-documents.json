        "Legal work runs on documents, and a significant portion of those documents arrive in formats that aren't natively searchable. Medical records faxed from provider offices, court filings scanned at the clerk's office, contracts photocopied during discovery, and handwritten notes from treating physicians or field investigators — these are the everyday reality of litigation. When documents are not searchable, your team can't find key facts, can't run searches across a case file, and can't feed records into summarization or e-discovery tools without first converting them to usable text.",
        "Traditional OCR tools were designed for clean, typed documents — business letters, printed forms, and standard office documents. They struggle with the materials that legal professionals encounter daily: low-resolution scans, documents with mixed handwriting and printed text, faded faxes, medical records with stamps and annotations overlaying text, and multi-column layouts common in older court filings. The result is garbled text output that requires extensive manual correction, often taking nearly as long as retyping the document from scratch.",
        "Dodonai's {{link:/ai-pdf-ocr/|AI-powered OCR}} is built to handle the document types that legal teams actually work with. It uses advanced language models to understand context, not just recognize individual characters, which means it can accurately interpret handwritten physician notes, correctly read text on degraded scans, and maintain the logical structure of complex document layouts. The extracted text is immediately available for search, and it integrates directly with Dodonai's {{link:/ai-medical-record-summaries-chronologies/|medical record summarization}} and {{link:/electronic-discovery-software/|e-discovery}} workflows — so you can go from a scanned PDF to a searchable, summarized document without switching tools."

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How is AI OCR different from traditional OCR for legal documents?",
      "answer": "Traditional OCR works by recognizing individual characters based on their visual shape, which fails on degraded scans, handwritten text, and complex layouts common in legal documents. Dodonai's {{link:/ai-pdf-ocr/|AI OCR}} uses large language models to understand context — it recognizes that a string of characters in a medical record is likely a diagnosis or medication name, which dramatically improves accuracy on the document types legal teams work with daily."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Dodonai's OCR read handwritten physician notes?",
      "answer": "Yes. Handwriting recognition is one of the key advantages of AI-powered OCR over traditional tools. Dodonai's AI interprets handwritten notes by understanding medical terminology and contextual clues, producing accurate transcriptions from physician notes, investigator reports, and handwritten annotations on legal documents."
    },
    {
      "question": "What types of legal documents does Dodonai's OCR handle?",
      "answer": "Dodonai processes scanned court filings, faxed medical records, photocopied contracts, discovery document productions, handwritten notes, older filings from microfilm or microfiche conversions, and any other image-based PDF. If a human can read it, Dodonai's AI OCR can extract the text."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does the OCR output integrate with other Dodonai tools?",
      "answer": "Yes. The text extracted by Dodonai's OCR feeds directly into the platform's other capabilities. Scanned medical records can be processed into {{link:/ai-medical-record-summaries-chronologies/|medical chronologies and summaries}}. Scanned discovery documents can be loaded into the {{link:/electronic-discovery-software/|e-discovery}} workflow. There is no need to export OCR output and re-upload it to a different tool."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Dodonai's OCR HIPAA compliant?",
      "answer": "Yes. All OCR processing occurs on Dodonai's HIPAA-compliant platform with signed Business Associate Agreements. Documents are encrypted with AES-256 in transit and at rest, and the platform is SOC 2 Type II certified. Your scanned documents are never used to train AI models."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does AI OCR for legal documents cost?",
      "answer": "Dodonai uses credit-based pricing where 1 credit equals approximately 1 page. Plans start at $30 per month for 200 credits on the Lite plan, $60 per month for 1,000 credits on the Basic plan, and $100 per month for 5,000 credits on the Pro plan. Enterprise pricing is available for high-volume users. Compared to manual transcription at $1 to $5 per page, AI OCR is far more cost-effective while delivering comparable accuracy."
