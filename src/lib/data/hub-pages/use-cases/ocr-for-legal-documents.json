        "Legal work runs on documents, and a significant portion arrive in formats that aren't natively searchable. Medical records faxed from provider offices, court filings scanned at the clerk's office, contracts photocopied during discovery, handwritten notes from treating physicians — this is where OCR for legal documents becomes essential. When documents aren't searchable, your team can't find key facts, can't run searches across a case file, and can't feed records into summarization or e-discovery tools.",
        "Traditional OCR was designed for clean, typed documents. It struggles with what legal professionals encounter daily: low-resolution scans, mixed handwriting and printed text, faded faxes, medical records with stamps overlaying text. The result is garbled output that requires extensive manual correction — sometimes taking as long as retyping from scratch.",
        "Dodonai's {{link:/ai-pdf-ocr/|AI-powered OCR}} handles the document types legal teams actually work with. It uses language models to understand context, not just recognize characters, which means it accurately interprets handwritten physician notes, reads text on degraded scans, and maintains complex document layouts. Extracted text integrates directly with Dodonai's {{link:/ai-medical-record-summaries-chronologies/|medical record summarization}} and {{link:/electronic-discovery-software/|e-discovery}} workflows — scanned PDF to searchable, summarized document without switching tools."

    {
      "question": "How is AI OCR different from traditional OCR for legal documents?",
      "answer": "Traditional OCR recognizes characters by shape, which fails on degraded scans, handwriting, and complex layouts. Dodonai's {{link:/ai-pdf-ocr/|AI OCR}} uses language models to understand context — recognizing that a string in a medical record is likely a diagnosis or medication — dramatically improving accuracy on legal document types."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Dodonai's OCR read handwritten physician notes?",
      "answer": "Yes. The AI interprets handwritten notes using medical terminology and contextual clues, producing accurate transcriptions from physician notes, investigator reports, and handwritten annotations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What types of legal documents does Dodonai's OCR handle?",
      "answer": "Scanned court filings, faxed medical records, photocopied contracts, discovery productions, handwritten notes, older filings from microfilm conversions, and any other image-based PDF. If a human can read it, Dodonai's AI OCR can extract the text."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does the OCR output integrate with other Dodonai tools?",
      "answer": "Yes. Scanned medical records flow directly into {{link:/ai-medical-record-summaries-chronologies/|chronology and summary}} generation. Scanned discovery documents load into the {{link:/electronic-discovery-software/|e-discovery}} workflow. No need to export and re-upload."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Dodonai's OCR HIPAA compliant?",
      "answer": "Every plan includes HIPAA compliance, SOC 2 Type II certification, and AES-256 encryption. We sign BAAs and your scanned documents never train our models."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does AI OCR for legal documents cost?",
      "answer": "Credit-based pricing: 1 credit per page. Lite is $30/month for 200 credits, Basic is $60/month for 1,000, Pro is $100/month for 5,000. Enterprise pricing available for high-volume users. Compared to manual transcription at $1-$5 per page, AI OCR is far more cost-effective."
