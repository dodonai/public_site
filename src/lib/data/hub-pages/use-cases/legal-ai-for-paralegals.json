        "Paralegals are the backbone of document processing in litigation. Building medical chronologies, drafting deposition digests, searching transcript testimony, organizing discovery, preparing privilege logs — these tasks consume most of your day. They're also where paralegal software with AI delivers the most immediate productivity gains.",
        "Dodonai is built for how paralegals actually work. Upload a stack of medical records and get a complete chronology in minutes instead of spending a full day on SOAP notes. Upload a deposition transcript and receive a page-line summary instead of drafting one from scratch over hours. Search across all transcripts in a case with a plain-English query instead of scrolling through hundreds of pages.",
        "The AI handles reading, extracting, and formatting — the mechanical labor that eats time without requiring your expertise. You handle the analysis and quality control attorneys depend on: reviewing chronologies for case issues, flagging testimony inconsistencies, making sure work product is right before it goes to the attorney."

    {
      "question": "Will AI replace paralegals in law firms?",
      "answer": "Not a chance. AI automates the repetitive parts — reading hundreds of pages, extracting data, formatting outputs. That frees you for the analytical work attorneys actually depend on: evaluating chronologies for case issues, spotting testimony inconsistencies, organizing exhibits, and managing client communication. Paralegals who adopt AI paralegal software handle more cases at higher quality."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much time can a paralegal save using Dodonai?",
      "answer": "A medical chronology that takes 8-12 hours manually is generated in under 15 minutes. A deposition digest that takes 3-5 hours is ready in about 3 minutes. Transcript searches take seconds. Most paralegals report saving several hours per day on document processing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need technical skills to use Dodonai?",
      "answer": "No. Upload a document, select the output type, optionally enter key topics, and download. Most paralegals are comfortable within their first session. No coding or IT support required."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I customize the output to match my firm's templates?",
      "answer": "Yes. Multiple export formats including PDF, Word, Excel, and plain text. Customize detail level, filter by provider or date range, and adjust summary structure. For advanced customization, {{link:/dodonai-extract-and-draft-agents/|Extract and Draft Agents}} let you build reusable templates matching your firm's exact requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Dodonai secure enough for confidential legal documents?",
      "answer": "Your firm's documents stay confidential. HIPAA compliant, SOC 2 Type II certified, AES-256 encrypted at every step. BAAs signed on every account. Your files never touch a training pipeline, and your firm sets the deletion schedule."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does this paralegal software cost?",
      "answer": "Plans are based on page volume, not user seats — per-page costs range from $0.15 down to $0.02 depending on plan. Multiple paralegals and attorneys share the same account. Visit our {{link:/pricing/|pricing page}} for current rates."
