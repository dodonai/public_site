        "Paralegals are the backbone of document processing in litigation. Building medical chronologies, drafting deposition digests, searching transcript testimony, organizing discovery, preparing privilege logs. These tasks consume most of your day. They're also where paralegal software saves the most time.",
        "Dodonai is litigation support software built for how paralegals actually work. Upload a stack of medical records and get a complete chronology in minutes instead of spending a full day on SOAP notes. Upload a deposition transcript and receive a page-line summary instead of drafting one from scratch over hours. Search across all transcripts in a case with a plain-English query instead of scrolling through hundreds of pages.",
        "The AI handles reading, extracting, and formatting: the mechanical labor that eats time without requiring your expertise. You handle the analysis and quality control attorneys depend on: reviewing chronologies for case issues, flagging testimony inconsistencies, making sure work product is right before it goes to the attorney."

    {
      "question": "Will AI replace paralegals in law firms?",
      "answer": "Not a chance. AI automates the repetitive parts: reading hundreds of pages, extracting data, formatting outputs. That frees you for the analytical work attorneys actually depend on: evaluating chronologies for case issues, spotting testimony inconsistencies, organizing exhibits, and managing client communication. Paralegals who adopt AI paralegal software handle more cases at higher quality."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much time can a paralegal save using Dodonai?",
      "answer": "A medical chronology that takes 8-12 hours manually is generated in under 15 minutes. A deposition digest that takes 3-5 hours is ready in about 3 minutes. Transcript searches take seconds. On a typical day with one medical record set and one deposition transcript, that's 10+ hours of manual work handled in under 20 minutes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need technical skills to use Dodonai?",
      "answer": "No. Upload a document, select the output type, optionally enter key topics, and download. Most paralegals are comfortable within their first session. No coding or IT support required."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I customize the output to match my firm's templates?",
      "answer": "Yes. Multiple export formats including PDF, Word, Excel, and plain text. Customize detail level, filter by provider or date range, and adjust summary structure. For advanced customization, {{link:/dodonai-extract-and-draft-agents/|Extract and Draft Agents}} let you build reusable templates matching your firm's exact requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Dodonai secure enough for confidential legal documents?",
      "answer": "Confidentiality is built in. HIPAA compliant with signed BAAs, SOC 2 Type II certified, AES-256 encrypted throughout. Nothing you upload trains our models. Your firm decides when files are removed."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does this paralegal software cost?",
      "answer": "Plans are based on page volume, not user seats. Per-page costs range from $0.15 down to $0.02 depending on plan. Multiple paralegals and attorneys share the same account. Visit our {{link:/pricing/|pricing page}} for current rates."
