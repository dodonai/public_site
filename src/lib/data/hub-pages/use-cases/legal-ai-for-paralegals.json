        "Paralegals are the backbone of document processing in litigation. Building medical chronologies, drafting deposition summaries, searching through transcript testimony, organizing discovery productions, and formatting work product for attorney review — these tasks consume the majority of a paralegal's day. They are also the tasks where AI delivers the most immediate and measurable productivity gains.",
        "Dodonai is designed for the way paralegals actually work. Upload a stack of medical records and get a complete chronology in minutes instead of spending an entire day manually reading and extracting data points. Upload a deposition transcript and receive a page-line summary instead of spending hours drafting one from scratch. Search across all the transcripts in a case with a natural language query instead of scrolling through hundreds of pages looking for a specific statement.",
        "The goal is not to replace paralegal judgment — it is to eliminate the mechanical labor that consumes your time without requiring your expertise. AI handles the reading, extracting, and formatting. You handle the analysis, quality control, and case strategy support that attorneys depend on."

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Will AI replace paralegals in law firms?",
      "answer": "No. AI tools like Dodonai automate the repetitive, time-consuming parts of document processing — reading through hundreds of pages, extracting data, and formatting outputs. This frees paralegals to focus on the analytical and strategic work that requires human judgment: evaluating the quality of medical evidence, identifying inconsistencies in testimony, organizing case strategy materials, and communicating with attorneys and clients. Paralegals who use AI tools effectively become more productive and more valuable to their firms."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much time can a paralegal save using Dodonai?",
      "answer": "The time savings depend on the task. A medical chronology that takes 8-12 hours to build manually is generated in under 15 minutes. A deposition summary that takes 3-5 hours to draft is ready in about 3 minutes. Transcript search that requires scrolling through hundreds of pages takes seconds with AI-powered queries. Most paralegals report saving several hours per day on document processing tasks."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need technical skills to use Dodonai?",
      "answer": "No. Dodonai is designed for legal professionals, not technologists. The workflow is straightforward: upload a document, select the output type, optionally enter key topics, and download the result. Most paralegals are comfortable using the platform within their first session. No coding, API knowledge, or IT support is required."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I customize the output to match my firm's templates?",
      "answer": "Yes. Dodonai supports multiple export formats including PDF, Word, Excel, and plain text. You can customize the level of detail, filter by provider or date range, and adjust the summary structure. For more advanced customization, the {{link:/dodonai-extract-and-draft-agents/|Extract and Draft Agents}} feature lets you build reusable templates that match your firm's exact formatting requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Dodonai secure enough for confidential legal documents?",
      "answer": "Yes. Dodonai is SOC 2 Type II certified and HIPAA compliant. All documents are encrypted using AES-256 in transit and at rest. Your data is never used to train AI models, and you maintain full control over data retention and deletion. These security standards meet the requirements of law firms handling privileged attorney-client communications and protected health information."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does Dodonai cost for a paralegal to use?",
      "answer": "Dodonai plans are based on page volume, not user seats. The Lite plan starts at $30 per month for 200 pages, the Basic plan is $60 per month for 1,000 pages, and the Pro plan is $100 per month for 5,000 pages. Multiple paralegals and attorneys can share the same account. Visit our {{link:/pricing/|pricing page}} for full details."
