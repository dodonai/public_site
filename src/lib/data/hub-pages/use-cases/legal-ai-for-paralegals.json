        "Paralegals are the backbone of document processing in litigation. Building medical chronologies, drafting deposition digests, searching transcript testimony, organizing discovery, preparing privilege logs — these tasks consume most of a paralegal's day. They're also where AI tools for legal paralegals deliver the most immediate productivity gains.",
        "Dodonai is designed for the way paralegals actually work. Upload a stack of medical records and get a complete chronology in minutes instead of spending a full day reading SOAP notes. Upload a deposition transcript and receive a page-line summary instead of hours drafting one from scratch. Search across all transcripts in a case with a natural language query instead of scrolling through hundreds of pages.",
        "AI handles the reading, extracting, and formatting — the mechanical labor that eats up time without requiring your expertise. You handle the analysis and quality control attorneys depend on: reviewing chronologies for case issues, flagging testimony inconsistencies, and making sure work product is right before it goes to the attorney."

      "answer": "No. AI automates the repetitive parts — reading hundreds of pages, extracting data, formatting outputs. That frees paralegals for the analytical work: evaluating chronologies for case issues, spotting testimony inconsistencies, organizing exhibits, and communicating with attorneys. Paralegals who use AI tools handle more cases at higher quality."

    {
      "question": "How much time can a paralegal save using Dodonai?",
      "answer": "A medical chronology that takes 8-12 hours manually is generated in under 15 minutes. A deposition digest that takes 3-5 hours is ready in about 3 minutes. Transcript searches take seconds. Most paralegals report saving several hours per day on document processing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need technical skills to use Dodonai?",
      "answer": "No. Upload a document, select the output type, optionally enter key topics, and download. Most paralegals are comfortable within their first session. No coding or IT support required."

    {
      "question": "Can I customize the output to match my firm's templates?",

    },
    {
      "question": "How much does Dodonai cost for a paralegal to use?",
      "answer": "Plans are based on page volume, not user seats — per-page costs range from $0.15 down to $0.02 depending on plan. Multiple paralegals and attorneys can share the same account. Visit our {{link:/pricing/|pricing page}} for details."
