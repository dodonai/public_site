        "Manual medical record review hasn't changed much in decades: open the file, read every page, take notes, build the chronology. For a 500-page record set, that's a full day of paralegal time. Multiply that across an active caseload and the math stops working.",
        "AI medical record review changes the equation. Instead of reading every page line by line, Dodonai ingests the full record set, identifies key medical events, and produces a structured medical record summary — including {{link:/ai-medical-record-summaries-chronologies/|chronologies and narrative summaries}} — your team can use immediately. The AI works across provider documentation styles, recognizes clinical terminology in context, and organizes events chronologically with page numbers pointing to the original.",
        "For law firms handling personal injury, medical malpractice, or mass tort cases, this means faster case evaluations, more consistent work product, and lower costs per case. For medical review services and {{link:/industries/ime-companies/|IME companies}}, it means scaling operations without proportionally scaling headcount."
