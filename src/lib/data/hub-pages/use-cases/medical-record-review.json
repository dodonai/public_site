        "Medical record review is one of the most time-intensive tasks in litigation and insurance claims. Reviewers must sift through hundreds or thousands of pages of clinical notes, lab results, imaging reports, and provider correspondence to extract the details that matter for a case. When done manually, this process is slow, expensive, and prone to human error.",
        "AI-powered medical record review changes the equation entirely. Instead of reading every page line by line, Dodonai's platform ingests the full record set, identifies key medical events, and produces structured outputs — including {{link:/ai-medical-record-summaries-chronologies/|medical record summaries and chronologies}} — that legal professionals can use immediately. The AI understands medical terminology, recognizes provider relationships, and organizes events in chronological order.",
        "For law firms handling personal injury, medical malpractice, or mass tort cases, this means faster case evaluations, more consistent work product, and significantly lower costs per case. For medical review services and {{link:/industries/ime-companies/|IME companies}}, it means the ability to scale operations without proportionally scaling headcount."

      "answer": "Dodonai's AI is trained to identify and extract key medical events with high precision, and every summary includes source-linked citations so reviewers can verify any data point against the original record. The AI reduces the risk of human oversight errors that commonly occur when reviewers process large volumes of records manually."
    },
    {
      "question": "What types of medical records can Dodonai process?",
      "answer": "Dodonai handles virtually any medical record format including digital PDFs, scanned documents, faxed records, and files with handwritten physician notes. The {{link:/ai-pdf-ocr/|AI OCR engine}} extracts text from even low-quality scans, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the full record set."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the platform HIPAA compliant?",
      "answer": "Yes. Dodonai encrypts all data in transit and at rest using AES-256 encryption, maintains SOC 2 Type II certification, and signs Business Associate Agreements with every client. You retain full control over your data, including the ability to delete records at any time."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does it take to review a medical record set?",
      "answer": "Most record sets are processed in minutes, regardless of length. A 500-page medical record that might take a human reviewer 8-12 hours can be summarized and organized by Dodonai in under 15 minutes. Review time scales linearly, so bulk processing thousands of records is equally efficient."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I customize the output to match my firm's format?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Dodonai supports multiple export formats including PDF, Word, Excel, and plain text. You can customize the level of detail, filter by provider or date range, and configure the summary structure to align with your firm's existing templates and workflows."
    },
    {
      "question": "What practice areas benefit most from AI medical record review?",
      "answer": "Any litigation involving medical records benefits from AI-powered review.
