  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How does this help me write better IME reports?",
      "answer": "You get a structured view of the claimant's full medical history before the exam — so you know what to look for during the evaluation. Afterward, you cite specific page numbers from the record set in your IME report without hunting through the originals."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I focus the summary on a specific body system or date range?",
      "answer": "Yes. Specify focus areas when you upload — body systems, injury types, date ranges, or specific providers. The summary highlights what's relevant to your evaluation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does the AI handle records from multiple providers?",
      "answer": "Yes. Dodonai processes records from multiple providers and facilities within a single upload, organizing everything into one unified chronology. Provider names are preserved so you can see who documented each entry."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use the summary output as part of my IME report?",
      "answer": "Yes. Export the chronology in Word, PDF, or Excel. Many IME physicians include the AI-generated chronology as a reference appendix in their reports or use it as the foundation for their history-of-present-illness section."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Dodonai handle handwritten notes and poor-quality scans?",
      "answer": "Dodonai's {{link:/ai-pdf-ocr/|AI OCR engine}} processes handwritten physician notes, scanned documents, and faxed records. It extracts text from low-quality images so clinically relevant details aren't missed."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does it cost per case?",
      "answer": "Per-page pricing starting at $0.02/page on the Pro plan, with no minimums or seat fees. A typical 500-page IME record set costs under $10 to process — a fraction of what manual review runs. Visit our {{link:/pricing/|pricing page}} for current rates."
