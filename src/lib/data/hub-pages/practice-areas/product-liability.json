        "Design defect, manufacturing defect, failure to warn. Whatever the theory, discovery in product liability cases produces enormous volumes from both sides. Corporate emails, engineering specifications, quality control logs, regulatory submissions, and internal testing data from the defendant, alongside plaintiff medical records, treatment histories, and expert reports. The attorneys and paralegals who process this material efficiently are the ones who find the evidence that proves the case.",
        "Manual product liability document review isn't just slow; it's a strategic risk. When your team is buried in thousands of pages of medical records or wading through dozens of 30(b)(6) transcripts from corporate designees, critical details get missed. A treating physician's note about the mechanism of injury, a quality engineer's admission about a known defect, a gap in the defendant's production suggesting documents were withheld. These facts shape outcomes, and they're easy to overlook in manual review.",
        "Dodonai gives product liability teams the tools to process both sides of the case file. Upload plaintiff medical records and receive detailed {{link:/ai-medical-record-summaries-chronologies/|medical chronologies}} documenting the full injury timeline with source citations, giving you the foundation for your damages case. Upload deposition transcripts from 30(b)(6) designees, retained experts, and treating physicians and get {{link:/deposition-summary-software/|structured deposition summaries}} organized by topic or page-line reference. Run scanned manufacturing documents and regulatory filings through {{link:/ai-pdf-ocr/|AI-powered OCR}} to make every page searchable for {{link:/electronic-discovery-software/|e-discovery}} workflows. Processing is HIPAA compliant, SOC 2 certified, and AES-256 encrypted."
