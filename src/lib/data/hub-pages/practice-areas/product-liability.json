        "Product liability litigation is document-intensive on both sides of the case. Design defect under risk-utility, manufacturing defect, failure to warn — whatever the theory, the discovery phase produces enormous volumes of records — corporate emails, engineering specifications, quality control logs, regulatory submissions, and internal testing data from the defendant, alongside plaintiff medical records, treatment histories, and expert reports. The attorneys and paralegals who can process this material efficiently are the ones who find the evidence that proves the case.",
        "Manual document review in product liability cases isn't just slow — it's a strategic risk. When your team is buried in thousands of pages of medical records or wading through dozens of 30(b)(6) deposition transcripts from corporate designees, critical details get missed. A treating physician's note about the mechanism of injury, a quality engineer's admission about a known defect, a gap in the defendant's production that suggests documents were withheld — these are the facts that shape case outcomes, and they are easy to overlook in a manual review process.",
        "Dodonai gives product liability teams the tools to process both sides of the case file. Upload plaintiff medical records and receive detailed {{link:/ai-medical-record-summaries-chronologies/|medical chronologies}} that document the full injury timeline with source citations — the foundation for your damages case and your specific causation experts. Upload deposition transcripts from 30(b)(6) corporate designees, retained experts, and treating physicians and get {{link:/deposition-summary-software/|structured deposition summaries}} organized by topic or page-line reference. Run scanned manufacturing documents and regulatory filings through {{link:/ai-pdf-ocr/|AI-powered OCR}} to make every page searchable and ready for {{link:/electronic-discovery-software/|e-discovery}} workflows. All processing is HIPAA compliant, SOC 2 Type II certified, and encrypted with AES-256."

      "question": "How does Dodonai help product liability attorneys process medical records?",
      "answer": "Dodonai processes plaintiff medical records and generates detailed {{link:/ai-medical-record-summaries-chronologies/|medical chronologies}} that document the injury, every treatment, surgery, medication, and provider visit in chronological order. Each entry includes a source-page citation, so attorneys can quickly verify details when drafting complaints, preparing experts, or building damages presentations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Dodonai summarize depositions from corporate representatives and expert witnesses?",
      "answer": "Yes. Dodonai processes deposition transcripts from any witness — 30(b)(6) corporate designees, retained and non-retained experts, treating physicians, or fact witnesses — and produces {{link:/deposition-summary-software/|structured summaries}} in page-line or narrative format. You can add key topics to focus the summary on product design decisions, manufacturing quality control, risk-utility considerations, or failure-to-warn evidence."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Dodonai handle scanned manufacturing documents in discovery?",
      "answer": "Product liability discovery frequently includes scanned engineering drawings, quality control logs, and regulatory filings. Dodonai's {{link:/ai-pdf-ocr/|AI-powered OCR}} extracts text from scanned and image-based PDFs, making them fully searchable. This eliminates the need for a separate OCR step before document review."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Dodonai secure enough for documents under protective orders?",
      "answer": "Yes. Dodonai is SOC 2 Type II certified and HIPAA compliant. All data is encrypted with AES-256 in transit and at rest. Your documents are never used to train AI models, and you retain full control over data retention and deletion. These controls meet the security standards required for handling documents subject to protective orders and confidentiality agreements."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does product liability document processing cost with Dodonai?",
      "answer": "Dodonai uses credit-based pricing where 1 credit equals approximately 1 page. Per-page costs range from $0.15 on the Lite plan down to $0.02 on the Pro plan, with Enterprise pricing available for larger volumes. Compare that to outsourced document review services at $5 to $15 per page for medical records alone — and product liability discovery often involves far more than medical records."
