        "Medical malpractice litigation involves some of the most document-intensive discovery in civil practice. A single case can generate thousands of pages of hospital records, physician SOAP notes, lab results, imaging reports, pharmacy records, nursing documentation, and institutional protocols spanning years of treatment across multiple providers and specialties. The sheer volume makes it easy to miss the clinical details that make or break a case.",
        "Beyond volume, medmal discovery presents unique analytical complexity. Your team needs to map the differential diagnosis process, evaluate treatment decisions against clinical practice guidelines for the relevant specialty, identify where the standard of care was breached, and trace a causal chain from the provider's actions to the patient's harm. In states requiring a pre-suit certificate of merit or affidavit of merit, you need this analysis organized before you can even file. Doing all of this manually — reading every page, cross-referencing providers and dates, building a coherent timeline from records that arrive disorganized — consumes weeks of paralegal and nurse reviewer time per case.",
        "AI document processing tools like Dodonai address both the volume and complexity challenges. The software extracts key clinical events, organizes them chronologically, and produces {{link:/ai-medical-record-summaries-chronologies/|detailed medical chronologies}} with source-page citations. This gives your team a structured foundation for identifying standard of care deviations, informed consent gaps, and the causation evidence your experts need to review.",
        "With organized chronologies and {{link:/deposition-summary-software/|deposition summaries}} generated in minutes rather than weeks, your attorneys can focus on the medical and legal analysis that determines case outcomes — evaluating whether the differential diagnosis was reasonable, whether the clinical practice guidelines were followed, and whether the causal chain holds up — rather than spending their time on document organization."

    {
      "question": "How does Dodonai help with medical malpractice case preparation?",
      "answer": "Dodonai processes voluminous medical records and deposition transcripts, producing organized chronologies and summaries in minutes. This structured output helps your team trace the differential diagnosis, identify where treatment deviated from accepted clinical practice guidelines, and map the causation chain — the foundation you need for expert review, certificate of merit compliance, and deposition preparation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Dodonai handle records from multiple hospitals and specialists?",
      "answer": "Yes. Medmal cases routinely involve records from the primary care physician, multiple specialists, one or more hospitals, and outpatient facilities. You can upload records from all providers, and Dodonai consolidates them into a unified, date-ordered chronology. The interactive viewer lets you filter by provider so you can isolate a specific physician's treatment decisions — useful when you are evaluating the differential diagnosis at a particular point in time or preparing to depose the treating specialist."
    },
    {
      "question": "How accurate are the AI-generated medical chronologies?",
      "answer": "Dodonai's chronologies include source-page citations for every entry, so your team can verify any extracted data point against the original record. We recommend that attorneys or qualified reviewers — whether a paralegal, nurse reviewer, or your retained expert — confirm key clinical findings before relying on them for standard of care opinions or causation arguments.

    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use Dodonai to prepare exhibits for expert witnesses?",
      "answer": "Yes. The chronologies and summaries Dodonai produces are designed to be shared with expert witnesses as organized reference documents. Instead of sending an expert thousands of pages of raw records, you can provide a structured timeline that helps them focus their review on the clinically relevant events."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Dodonai secure enough for medical malpractice records?",
      "answer": "Dodonai is HIPAA compliant with signed Business Associate Agreements and SOC 2 Type II certified. All documents are encrypted with AES-256 in transit and at rest. Your data is never used to train AI models, and you control when your data is deleted."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does AI document processing reduce costs for medmal firms?",
      "answer": "Medmal firms often spend thousands per case on outsourced record review and nurse reviewer services at $5 to $15 per page. Dodonai processes pages for as little as $0.02 each. For firms managing multiple active medmal cases — each with records from several hospitals and specialists — the per-case savings are significant, especially given the volume of records these cases generate."
