        "A single medmal case can generate thousands of pages of hospital records, SOAP notes, lab results, and imaging reports spanning years of treatment. Finding the clinical details that prove a breach in care means reading all of it. Medical malpractice record analysis at this volume is where cases stall or accelerate.",
        "Beyond volume, medmal discovery presents unique analytical complexity. Your team needs to map the differential diagnosis process, evaluate treatment decisions against clinical practice guidelines, identify where the standard of care was breached, and trace a causal chain from the provider's actions to the patient's harm. In states requiring a pre-suit certificate of merit, you need this analysis organized before you can even file.",
        "Doing all of this manually (reading every page, cross-referencing providers and dates, building a coherent timeline from disorganized records) consumes weeks of paralegal and nurse reviewer time per case. AI-powered medmal discovery processing eliminates that bottleneck.",
        "Dodonai extracts key clinical events, organizes them chronologically, and produces {{link:/ai-medical-record-summaries-chronologies/|detailed medical chronologies}} so you can verify any claim against the source document. This gives your team a structured foundation for identifying standard of care deviations, informed consent gaps, and the causation evidence your experts need.",
        "With organized chronologies and {{link:/deposition-summary-software/|deposition summaries}} generated in minutes, your attorneys can focus on evaluating whether the differential diagnosis was reasonable, whether clinical practice guidelines were followed, and whether the causal chain holds up."

      "heading": "Built for the Detail Medmal Cases Demand",
      "paragraphs": [
        "Medical malpractice attorneys hold their work product to a higher standard than most practice areas, and they should. When a case hinges on whether a physician deviated from accepted clinical practice at a specific moment in the treatment timeline, a generic AI summary that skips dates or glosses over provider notes is worse than useless. We hear this concern often, and it shaped how we built the platform.",
        "Dodonai does not produce a single fixed summary and call it done. Every medical chronology includes the granular clinical detail medmal attorneys depend on: individual provider entries, medication changes, lab values, diagnostic imaging findings, referral patterns, and informed consent documentation, each tied to a specific source page in the original records. If a nurse's note at 2:14 AM documents a change in patient status that the attending didn't act on until morning rounds, that gap shows up in the chronology with citations to both entries.",
        "Where Dodonai goes further is {{link:/dodonai-extract-and-draft-agents/|complete customization of your output}}. Every firm works differently. Some want chronologies broken out by treating provider. Others need entries grouped by body system or organized around specific allegations. You can define custom data fields, choose narrative or tabular formats, build reusable templates that match your firm's preferred layout, and adjust the level of detail from high-level executive summaries down to line-by-line clinical extraction. The output conforms to your workflow, not the other way around.",
        "For firms that want an extra layer of confidence, Dodonai supports a human-in-the-loop review process. Use AI to do the heavy lifting of organizing and extracting thousands of pages of records, then have your nurse reviewers or paralegals verify the structured output against the source documents in our side-by-side viewer. Your team spends their time on quality assurance and clinical judgment instead of data entry. It is the difference between spending 40 hours building a chronology from scratch and spending 4 hours reviewing one that is already 95% there.",
        "The firms getting the most from AI-powered medical malpractice document processing are not the ones replacing human review entirely. They are the ones using AI to eliminate the repetitive extraction work so their experienced reviewers can focus on what actually requires medical and legal expertise: identifying the standard of care breach, evaluating causation, and building the narrative that wins at trial."

      "question": "How does Dodonai help with medical malpractice case preparation?",
      "answer": "Dodonai processes voluminous records and transcripts into organized chronologies and summaries in minutes. The structured output helps your team trace the differential diagnosis, identify treatment deviations from clinical practice guidelines, and map the causation chain. That structured output becomes the foundation for expert review and deposition prep."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Dodonai handle records from multiple hospitals and specialists?",
      "answer": "Yes. Upload records from all providers and Dodonai consolidates them into a unified, date-ordered chronology. Filter by provider to isolate a specific physician's treatment decisions, which is useful when evaluating the differential diagnosis at a particular point in time."
    },
    {
      "question": "How accurate are the AI-generated medical chronologies?",
      "answer": "Every entry includes a source-page citation so your team can verify against the original record. We recommend attorneys or qualified reviewers confirm key clinical findings before relying on them for standard of care opinions. Read more about {{link:/blog/understanding-medical-chronology-clear-actionable-timelines/|building actionable medical chronologies}}."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use Dodonai to prepare exhibits for expert witnesses?",
      "answer": "Yes. The chronologies and summaries are designed to be shared with experts as organized reference documents: a structured timeline instead of thousands of pages of raw records."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Dodonai secure enough for medical malpractice records?",
      "answer": "The PHI in medmal records demands the highest standard. BAAs signed before your first upload, SOC 2 certified infrastructure, AES-256 encryption throughout. Your records never train our models, and retention follows your firm's policy."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are AI medical record summaries detailed enough for medical malpractice cases?",
      "answer": "This is the most common concern we hear from medmal attorneys, and it is a fair one. Dodonai chronologies include the clinical granularity these cases require: individual provider entries with dates and times, medication dosages, lab values, imaging findings, referral chains, and informed consent notes, each linked to a source page. You can also customize output format, detail level, and data fields to match your firm's requirements. For firms that want additional assurance, our side-by-side viewer supports a human-in-the-loop workflow where nurse reviewers verify the AI output against original records, turning a 40-hour manual build into a 4-hour quality review."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does AI document processing reduce costs for medmal firms?",
      "answer": "Outsourced nurse reviewers typically charge $5 to $15 per page. Dodonai processes pages for as little as $0.02 each. A 2,000-page record set that costs $10,000+ from a vendor runs under $40 with Dodonai. Multiply that across 10 active cases."
