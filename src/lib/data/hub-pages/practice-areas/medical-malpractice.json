        "Medical malpractice litigation involves some of the most document-intensive discovery in all of civil practice. A single case can generate thousands of pages of hospital records, physician notes, lab results, imaging reports, pharmacy records, and nursing documentation spanning years of treatment. The sheer volume makes it easy to miss critical details that could make or break a case.",
        "Beyond the volume, medmal discovery presents unique complexity. Your team needs to understand the standard of care for the relevant specialty, identify deviations from that standard, and trace a causal chain from the provider's actions to the patient's harm. Doing this manually requires reading every page, cross-referencing providers and dates, and building a coherent timeline from records that often arrive disorganized and out of order.",
        "AI document processing tools like Dodonai address both the volume and complexity challenges. The software extracts key medical events, organizes them chronologically, and produces {{link:/ai-medical-record-summaries-chronologies/|detailed medical chronologies}} with source-page citations. This gives your team a structured foundation for identifying the standard of care issues and causation evidence that drive medical malpractice claims.",
        "With organized chronologies and {{link:/deposition-summary-software/|deposition summaries}} generated in minutes rather than weeks, your attorneys can focus on the medical and legal analysis that determines case outcomes, rather than spending their time on document organization."
