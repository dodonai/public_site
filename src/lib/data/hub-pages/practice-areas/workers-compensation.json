        "Workers' compensation cases are built on medical documentation. Every claim requires a detailed understanding of the claimant's injury, treatment timeline, work restrictions, and progression from initial treatment through MMI to permanent impairment rating. Claimant attorneys need organized medical histories that trace the full arc from date of injury through TTD, any surgical interventions, and the treating physician's final work restrictions. Defense attorneys and adjusters need the same organized records to evaluate exposure, identify pre-existing conditions for apportionment arguments, and assess whether treatment was reasonable and necessary — especially when utilization review disputes are in play.",
        "The challenge is volume and complexity. A single workers' comp claim can involve records from emergency departments, orthopedic specialists, pain management clinics, physical therapy providers, primary care physicians, IME doctors, and QME or AME evaluators. These records arrive in different formats — digital PDFs from hospital systems, scanned faxes from smaller providers, handwritten physician notes. Manually organizing them into a coherent treatment timeline that tracks each provider's findings on work restrictions, impairment, and functional capacity consumes hours of paralegal time per claim.",
        "Dodonai automates the most labor-intensive part of that process. Upload the claimant's full medical record set and receive a structured {{link:/ai-medical-record-summaries-chronologies/|medical chronology}} that organizes every diagnosis, treatment, medication, work status change, and provider visit by date with source-page citations. Scanned and handwritten records are processed automatically through {{link:/ai-pdf-ocr/|AI-powered OCR}}, so no records are left behind. When depositions are taken — from the claimant, treating physicians, or IME doctors — Dodonai generates {{link:/deposition-summary-software/|deposition summaries}} that highlight the testimony most relevant to the claim. All processing is HIPAA compliant, SOC 2 Type II certified, and encrypted with AES-256."

    {
      "question": "How does Dodonai help with workers' comp medical record review?",
      "answer": "Dodonai processes the claimant's full medical record set and generates a structured {{link:/ai-medical-record-summaries-chronologies/|medical chronology}} that organizes every diagnosis, treatment, surgery, medication, and provider visit in chronological order. Each entry includes source-page citations so attorneys or adjusters can verify any detail against the original records. This replaces the hours of manual review typically required to build a treatment timeline."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Dodonai identify treatment gaps and pre-existing conditions?",
      "answer": "Dodonai's chronological output makes treatment gaps immediately visible — if there is a period with no documented visits between two providers, it shows clearly in the timeline. For pre-existing conditions, the chronology captures the full medical history as documented in the records, which is critical for both sides: claimant counsel needs to anticipate apportionment arguments, and defense counsel needs to identify prior injuries or degenerative conditions that may reduce the compensable percentage of permanent disability."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does Dodonai handle records from multiple workers' comp providers?",
      "answer": "Yes. Workers' comp cases typically involve records from emergency departments, orthopedic surgeons, pain management specialists, physical therapists, primary care physicians, IME doctors, and QME or AME evaluators. You can upload records from all providers, and Dodonai consolidates them into a single unified chronology organized by date — so you can see how the treating physician's opinions compare to the IME findings and track every work restriction change in one place."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Dodonai HIPAA compliant for workers' compensation records?",
      "answer": "Yes. Dodonai is HIPAA compliant with signed Business Associate Agreements and SOC 2 Type II certified. All claimant data is encrypted with AES-256 in transit and at rest. Your data is never used to train AI models, and you retain full control over data retention and deletion."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does workers' comp document processing cost with Dodonai?",
      "answer": "Dodonai uses credit-based pricing where 1 credit equals approximately 1 page. Per-page costs range from $0.15 on the Lite plan down to $0.02 on the Pro plan, with Enterprise pricing available for higher volumes. Compared to outsourced medical record review at $5 to $15 per page, Dodonai reduces per-claim processing costs significantly — especially for firms or carriers managing a high volume of open claims."
