        "Personal injury litigation depends on clear, well-organized documentation. From the initial medical records request through discovery and into trial preparation, your team is constantly processing, summarizing, and cross-referencing large volumes of documents. The firms that do this efficiently gain an edge in case valuation, settlement negotiations, and courtroom presentation.",
        "AI document processing tools like Dodonai compress what used to take days of paralegal time into minutes of automated work. Upload a plaintiff's medical records and receive a complete {{link:/ai-medical-record-summaries-chronologies/|medical chronology}} with provider-by-provider timelines, diagnoses, treatments, and source-page citations. Upload a deposition transcript and get a {{link:/deposition-summary-software/|page-line or narrative summary}} ready for attorney review.",
        "This is not about replacing your team's judgment. It is about eliminating the mechanical work of reading, extracting, and formatting so that attorneys and paralegals can spend their time on analysis, strategy, and client communication. For high-volume PI firms handling dozens or hundreds of active cases, AI document processing is a force multiplier.",
        "Dodonai is SOC 2 Type II certified and HIPAA compliant, which means your clients' protected health information stays secure throughout the summarization process."

    {
      "question": "How does Dodonai help with personal injury medical record summaries?",
      "answer": "Dodonai processes your plaintiff's medical records and generates a detailed chronology that organizes every diagnosis, treatment, provider visit, and prescription by date. It also produces a narrative summary of the patient's overall medical history. Both outputs include source-page citations so your team can verify any data point against the original records."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use Dodonai to prepare demand letters?",
      "answer": "Yes. The medical chronologies and summaries that Dodonai generates provide the organized medical evidence you need to draft compelling demand letters. Having a clear timeline of injury, treatment, and prognosis helps you articulate damages more effectively and support your settlement demand with documented medical facts."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much can a PI firm save with AI document processing?",
      "answer": "The savings depend on your volume, but most PI firms spend thousands of dollars per case on outsourced medical record review and deposition summary services. Dodonai plans start at $30 per month, and even the Pro plan at $100 per month handles up to 5,000 pages. For firms on contingency, reducing per-case costs directly improves profitability."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Dodonai secure enough for medical records and litigation documents?",
      "answer": "Yes. Dodonai is HIPAA compliant with signed Business Associate Agreements and SOC 2 Type II certified. All documents are encrypted with AES-256 in transit and at rest. Your data is never used to train AI models, and you have full control over data retention and deletion."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does Dodonai handle scanned medical records from providers?",
      "answer": "Yes. Dodonai includes built-in {{link:/ai-pdf-ocr/|AI-powered OCR}} that extracts text from scanned PDFs and image-based documents. You can upload records exactly as you receive them from medical providers without running them through a separate OCR tool first."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Dodonai handle records from multiple providers in a single case?",
      "answer": "Yes. You can upload records from multiple providers, and Dodonai will extract and organize the information into a unified chronology. The interactive viewer lets you filter entries by provider, date range, or event type so you can focus on specific aspects of the medical history."
