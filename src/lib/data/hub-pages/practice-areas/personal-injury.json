        "Every PI case follows the same documentation arc: records requests go out after intake, medical records pile up from ERs, orthopedics, and PT, your team builds the med chron, and then the real work begins — evaluating specials, projecting future medicals, putting together a demand package that moves the adjuster. Firms that compress the documentation cycle send demands sooner and resolve cases faster.",
        "AI for personal injury lawyers starts with the most time-consuming task: medical record review. A personal injury medical record summary used to mean days of paralegal time per case. Dodonai handles it in minutes. Upload a plaintiff's records and receive a complete {{link:/ai-medical-record-summaries-chronologies/|medical chronology}} with provider-by-provider timelines, diagnoses, treatments, and source-page citations — the organized foundation for calculating specials, identifying treatment gaps, and supporting your damages narrative. Upload a deposition transcript and get a {{link:/deposition-summary-software/|page-line or narrative summary}} flagging liability admissions, causation testimony, and damages evidence.",
        "Your attorneys and paralegals still drive case valuation, settlement strategy, and client communication — AI just eliminates the mechanical work that eats up their time. Policy limits demand, soft-tissue demand package, life care plan foundation for a catastrophic injury — whatever you're assembling, it starts with organized documentation.",
        "Your clients' records stay protected — HIPAA compliant with signed BAAs on every account, SOC 2 Type II certified, AES-256 encrypted."

    {
      "question": "How does Dodonai help with personal injury medical record summaries?",
      "answer": "Upload your plaintiff's records and get a chronology organized by date — ER visits, specialist referrals, surgeries, PT sessions, medication changes, and IME findings in sequence with page citations. Quickly identify specials, treatment gaps, and provider relationships that matter for case evaluation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use Dodonai to prepare demand letters?",
      "answer": "Yes. The medical chronologies give you the foundation a strong demand requires — documented specials, a clear treatment timeline from injury through MMI, and a provider narrative supporting your damages theory. Works for standard BI demands and policy limits demands alike."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much can a PI firm save with AI document processing?",
      "answer": "Record review vendors charge $5 to $15 per page; deposition summaries run $3 to $10. Dodonai processes pages for as little as $0.02 each. On a typical 500-page case with a couple of transcripts, that's thousands in vendor savings. For contingency firms advancing costs, it directly protects margins."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Dodonai secure enough for medical records and litigation documents?",
      "answer": "Built for the sensitivity PI records require. Signed BAAs before your first upload, SOC 2 Type II certification, AES-256 encryption on every file. Nothing trains our models, and deletion is on your timeline."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does Dodonai handle scanned medical records from providers?",
      "answer": "Yes. Built-in {{link:/ai-pdf-ocr/|AI-powered OCR}} extracts text from scanned PDFs and image-based documents. Upload records as you receive them from providers — no separate OCR step needed."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Dodonai handle records from multiple providers in a single case?",
      "answer": "Yes. Upload records from all providers and Dodonai organizes them into a unified chronology. Filter by provider, date range, or event type to focus on specific parts of the medical history."
