        "Every PI case follows the same documentation arc: records requests go out after intake, medical records pile up from ERs, orthopedics, pain management, and PT, your team builds the med chron, and then the real work begins — evaluating specials, projecting future medicals, and putting together a demand package that moves the adjuster. The firms that compress that documentation cycle are the ones sending demands sooner and resolving cases faster.",
        "AI document processing tools like Dodonai handle the heaviest part of that cycle. Upload a plaintiff's records and receive a complete {{link:/ai-medical-record-summaries-chronologies/|medical chronology}} with provider-by-provider timelines, diagnoses, treatments, and source-page citations — the same organized foundation you need for calculating specials, identifying treatment gaps, and supporting your damages narrative. Upload a deposition transcript and get a {{link:/deposition-summary-software/|page-line or narrative summary}} that flags liability admissions, causation testimony, and damages evidence ready for attorney review.",
        "This is not about replacing your team's judgment. It is about eliminating the mechanical work of reading, extracting, and formatting so that attorneys and paralegals can spend their time on case valuation, settlement strategy, and client communication. Whether you are preparing a policy limits demand, assembling a demand package for a soft-tissue case, or building the life care plan foundation for a catastrophic injury, organized documentation is where it all starts.",
        "Dodonai is SOC 2 Type II certified and HIPAA compliant, which means your clients' protected health information stays secure throughout the summarization process."

    {
      "question": "How does Dodonai help with personal injury medical record summaries?",
      "answer": "Dodonai processes your plaintiff's medical records and generates a detailed chronology organized by date — ER visits, specialist referrals, surgical procedures, PT sessions, medication changes, and IME findings all appear in sequence with source-page citations. It also produces a narrative summary of the overall medical history. Your team can verify any data point against the original records and quickly identify the specials, treatment gaps, and provider relationships that matter for case evaluation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use Dodonai to prepare demand letters?",
      "answer": "Yes. The medical chronologies Dodonai generates give you the organized foundation a strong demand package requires — documented specials, a clear treatment timeline from injury through MMI, and a provider-by-provider narrative that supports your damages theory. Whether you are putting together a standard BI demand or a policy limits demand designed to create bad faith exposure, the structured evidence is ready to incorporate."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much can a PI firm save with AI document processing?",
      "answer": "The savings depend on your volume. Record review vendors typically charge $5 to $15 per page, and deposition summary services run $3 to $10. Dodonai processes pages for as little as $0.02 each. On a typical PI case with 500 pages of medical records and a couple of transcripts, you are looking at thousands in vendor savings per case. For contingency firms advancing those costs, that directly protects your margins."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Dodonai secure enough for medical records and litigation documents?",
      "answer": "Yes. Dodonai is HIPAA compliant with signed Business Associate Agreements and SOC 2 Type II certified. All documents are encrypted with AES-256 in transit and at rest. Your data is never used to train AI models, and you have full control over data retention and deletion."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does Dodonai handle scanned medical records from providers?",
      "answer": "Yes. Dodonai includes built-in {{link:/ai-pdf-ocr/|AI-powered OCR}} that extracts text from scanned PDFs and image-based documents. You can upload records exactly as you receive them from medical providers without running them through a separate OCR tool first."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Dodonai handle records from multiple providers in a single case?",
      "answer": "Yes. You can upload records from multiple providers, and Dodonai will extract and organize the information into a unified chronology. The interactive viewer lets you filter entries by provider, date range, or event type so you can focus on specific aspects of the medical history."
