        "Mass tort litigation is defined by volume and the need for consistency across it. Whether you are managing an MDL with thousands of claimants, running a state-court consolidation, or building your firm's case inventory for a developing litigation, every plaintiff needs the same level of documentation: organized medical records, completed plaintiff fact sheets, and a damages profile your team can use for triage and settlement modeling.",
        "Traditional approaches do not scale to MDL volumes. Hiring additional paralegals, outsourcing to record review vendors at $5 to $15 per page, or relying on contract attorneys all introduce bottlenecks and inconsistencies. When the PSC sets a plaintiff fact sheet deadline or the transferee court orders a case census, you need to process hundreds of claimant files on the same timeline — not wait months for manual review to trickle in.",
        "AI document processing changes the economics. Dodonai's platform ingests medical records in bulk, generates {{link:/ai-medical-record-summaries-chronologies/|medical chronologies and summaries}} for each claimant, and delivers consistent, structured outputs your team can use immediately for PFS completion, bellwether selection, settlement grid stratification, and trial preparation. The AI handles scanned and handwritten records through built-in {{link:/ai-pdf-ocr/|OCR}}, so records from any provider are processed without manual preprocessing.",
        "Dodonai is SOC 2 Type II certified and HIPAA compliant, which means protected health information across all claimant files is handled with enterprise-grade security. Your data is encrypted with AES-256, never used to train AI models, and subject to your full control over retention and deletion."

    {
      "question": "Can Dodonai handle the volume of records in a mass tort case?",
      "answer": "Yes. Dodonai is built for MDL-scale volumes. You can upload and process medical records for hundreds or thousands of claimants, and the platform scales without degrading output quality. Each claimant receives the same structured chronology and summary — the kind of consistency you need when completing plaintiff fact sheets, meeting CMO deadlines, or building a case census across your entire inventory."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Dodonai ensure consistency across thousands of claimant summaries?",
      "answer": "Because the same AI model processes every record set using the same extraction logic, the output format and level of detail are consistent across all plaintiffs. This eliminates the variability that occurs when different paralegals or outsourced reviewers apply their own judgment to each file."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does mass tort document processing cost with Dodonai?",
      "answer": "Dodonai uses a credit-based pricing model where 1 credit equals approximately 1 page. Per-page costs range from $0.15 on the Lite plan down to $0.02 on the Pro plan. For mass tort volumes, Enterprise pricing with custom credit allocations is available. Compare that to $5 to $15 per page from traditional record review vendors — at MDL scale, the difference can be hundreds of thousands of dollars across your case inventory."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I process records from different providers for the same claimant?",
      "answer": "Yes. You can upload records from multiple healthcare providers for a single claimant, and Dodonai will extract and organize the information into a unified {{link:/ai-medical-record-summaries-chronologies/|medical chronology}}. The interactive viewer lets you filter entries by provider, date range, or event type."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Dodonai secure enough for mass tort medical records?",
      "answer": "Dodonai is HIPAA compliant with signed Business Associate Agreements and SOC 2 Type II certified. All data is encrypted with AES-256 in transit and at rest. Your claimant data is never used to train AI models, and you retain full control over data retention and deletion policies."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Dodonai handle scanned records from older medical providers?",
      "answer": "Mass tort cases often involve records from dozens of different providers, many of which deliver scanned PDFs, faxed copies, or documents with handwritten notes. Dodonai includes built-in {{link:/ai-pdf-ocr/|AI-powered OCR}} that extracts text from these documents automatically. You do not need to run records through a separate OCR tool before uploading."
