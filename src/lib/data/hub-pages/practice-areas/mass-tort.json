        "When you're managing 3,000 plaintiff files in an MDL, manual record review can't keep up. Every claimant needs the same level of documentation: organized medical records, completed plaintiff fact sheets, and a damages profile your team can use for triage and settlement modeling. Traditional approaches — hiring additional paralegals, outsourcing at $5 to $15 per page to nurse reviewers, or relying on contract attorneys — all introduce bottlenecks and inconsistencies that compound at scale. Mass tort software built for this volume changes the economics.",
        "When the PSC sets a plaintiff fact sheet deadline or the transferee court orders a case census, you need to process hundreds of claimant files on the same timeline — not wait months for manual review to trickle in. Mass tort medical record review at scale requires a fundamentally different approach to MDL document processing.",
        "Dodonai's platform ingests medical records in bulk, generates {{link:/ai-medical-record-summaries-chronologies/|medical chronologies and summaries}} for each claimant, and delivers consistent, structured outputs your team can use immediately for PFS completion, bellwether selection, settlement grid stratification, and trial preparation. The AI handles scanned and handwritten records through built-in {{link:/ai-pdf-ocr/|OCR}}, so records from any provider are processed without manual preprocessing.",

    {

      "answer": "Yes. Upload and process records for hundreds or thousands of claimants — the platform scales without degrading output quality. Each claimant gets the same structured chronology and summary, which is the consistency you need for plaintiff fact sheets and CMO deadlines."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Dodonai ensure consistency across thousands of claimant summaries?",
      "answer": "The same AI model processes every record set using identical extraction logic, so output format and detail level are uniform across all plaintiffs. No variability from different reviewers applying their own judgment."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does mass tort document processing cost with Dodonai?",
      "answer": "Per-page costs range from $0.15 on the Lite plan to $0.02 on Pro, with Enterprise pricing for custom volumes. Compare that to $5 to $15 per page from traditional vendors — at MDL scale, the difference runs into hundreds of thousands of dollars."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I process records from different providers for the same claimant?",
      "answer": "Yes. Upload records from multiple providers for a single claimant and Dodonai organizes them into a unified {{link:/ai-medical-record-summaries-chronologies/|medical chronology}}. Filter entries by provider, date range, or event type in the interactive viewer."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Dodonai secure enough for mass tort medical records?",
      "answer": "Thousands of claimant files means thousands of reasons to get security right. SOC 2 Type II certified, HIPAA compliant, AES-256 encrypted. Signed BAAs standard. Your data never trains our models. You set the retention policy."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Dodonai handle scanned records from older medical providers?",
      "answer": "Built-in {{link:/ai-pdf-ocr/|AI-powered OCR}} extracts text from scanned PDFs, faxed copies, and handwritten notes automatically. No separate OCR step before uploading."
