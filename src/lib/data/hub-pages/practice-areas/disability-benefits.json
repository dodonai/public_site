        "Disability benefits cases — whether Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), long-term disability (LTD) insurance claims, or VA disability — require exhaustive medical documentation to prove that a claimant's condition prevents them from working. Attorneys and representatives must review years of treatment records from multiple providers, identify relevant diagnoses and functional limitations, and present this evidence in a clear narrative that administrative law judges and insurance reviewers can follow.",
        "This document-heavy work is where most disability practices spend the bulk of their time. A single SSDI case can involve thousands of pages of records from primary care physicians, specialists, hospitals, therapists, and government agencies. Reviewing and organizing all of that manually is slow, expensive, and error-prone.",
        "Dodonai's AI document processing tools compress this work from days into minutes. Upload a claimant's medical records and receive a complete {{link:/ai-medical-record-summaries-chronologies/|medical chronology}} organized by date, provider, diagnosis, and treatment. The chronology includes source-page citations so your team can verify every data point against the original records before submitting to the Social Security Administration or an insurance carrier.",

      "question": "How does Dodonai help with SSDI medical record review?",
      "answer": "Dodonai processes your claimant's medical records and generates a detailed chronology that organizes every diagnosis, treatment, provider visit, and medication by date. It also produces narrative summaries by provider. Both outputs include source-page citations so your team can verify any data point against the original records before submitting evidence to the Social Security Administration."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Dodonai handle records from many different providers?",
      "answer": "Yes. Disability cases often involve records from primary care physicians, specialists, hospitals, mental health providers, and government agencies. You can upload records from all providers, and Dodonai will extract and organize the information into a unified chronology. The interactive viewer lets you filter entries by provider, date range, or diagnosis."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does Dodonai work for long-term disability insurance claims?",
      "answer": "Yes. The medical chronologies and summaries Dodonai generates are useful for any disability claim type, including employer-sponsored LTD claims, individual disability insurance claims, SSDI applications, and VA disability claims. The organized documentation helps you present medical evidence clearly regardless of the reviewing body."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much can a disability benefits practice save?",
      "answer": "Most disability practices spend significant time on manual medical record review or pay outsourced vendors $5 to $15 per page. Dodonai plans start at $30 per month and even the Pro plan at $100 per month handles up to 5,000 pages. For practices handling dozens of active claims, the cost savings are substantial."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Dodonai secure enough for claimant medical records?",
      "answer": "Yes. Dodonai is HIPAA compliant with signed Business Associate Agreements and SOC 2 Type II certified. All documents are encrypted with AES-256 in transit and at rest. Your data is never used to train AI models, and you have full control over data retention and deletion."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does Dodonai handle scanned medical records?",
      "answer": "Yes. Dodonai includes built-in {{link:/ai-pdf-ocr/|AI-powered OCR}} that extracts text from scanned PDFs and image-based documents. Many disability claimants' records arrive as scans from provider offices — you can upload them directly without running a separate OCR step first."
