        "Disability benefits cases — whether SSDI, long-term disability insurance claims, or VA disability — live and die on medical documentation. The SSA's five-step sequential evaluation hinges on whether your claimant's records support a Residual Functional Capacity (RFC) restrictive enough to preclude work, or whether the impairment meets or equals a Blue Book listing. LTD carriers run their own medical review, and VA claims require service-connection evidence. In every case, the quality and organization of the medical record presentation directly affects the outcome.",
        "This is where most disability practices spend the bulk of their time. A single SSDI case can involve thousands of pages of records from primary care physicians, specialists, hospitals, mental health providers, and government agencies — records that span years and need to be organized into a coherent timeline before the ALJ hearing. When the vocational expert testifies about whether jobs exist in the national economy for someone with your claimant's RFC, you need the medical evidence to support every functional limitation.",
        "Dodonai compresses that document organization work from days into minutes. Upload a claimant's medical records and receive a complete {{link:/ai-medical-record-summaries-chronologies/|medical chronology}} organized by date, provider, diagnosis, and treatment. The chronology includes source-page citations so your team can verify every data point against the original records before submitting to the SSA, an insurance carrier, or the VA — and quickly identify the treatment notes that document the functional limitations driving the RFC.",
        "Dodonai is SOC 2 Type II certified and HIPAA compliant, ensuring your claimants' protected health information stays secure throughout the review process."

    {
      "question": "How does Dodonai help with SSDI medical record review?",
      "answer": "Dodonai processes your claimant's medical records and generates a detailed chronology that organizes every diagnosis, treatment, provider visit, and medication by date. It also produces narrative summaries by provider. Both outputs include source-page citations so your team can quickly identify the treatment notes documenting functional limitations — the evidence the ALJ and vocational expert rely on when assessing RFC and determining whether the claimant can perform past relevant work or any other work in the national economy."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Dodonai handle records from many different providers?",
      "answer": "Yes. Disability cases often involve records from primary care physicians, specialists, hospitals, mental health providers, consultative examination (CE) reports, and government agencies. You can upload records from all providers, and Dodonai consolidates them into a unified chronology. The interactive viewer lets you filter by provider, date range, or diagnosis — useful when you need to isolate the mental health treatment notes for a Paragraph B analysis or track the progression of a physical impairment against Blue Book listing criteria."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does Dodonai work for long-term disability insurance claims?",
      "answer": "Yes. The medical chronologies and summaries Dodonai generates work for any disability claim type — SSDI applications moving through the five-step sequential evaluation, employer-sponsored LTD claims subject to ERISA review, individual disability policies, and VA disability claims requiring service-connection evidence. The organized documentation helps you present medical evidence clearly regardless of whether the reviewing body is an ALJ, an insurance carrier's medical reviewer, or a VA rater."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much can a disability benefits practice save?",
      "answer": "Most disability practices spend significant time on manual medical record review or pay outsourced vendors $5 to $15 per page. Dodonai processes pages for as little as $0.02 each. For practices handling dozens of active claims — each with records from multiple providers spanning years of treatment — the per-case savings add up quickly, especially for high-volume SSDI firms where margins depend on efficient case processing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Dodonai secure enough for claimant medical records?",
      "answer": "Yes. Dodonai is HIPAA compliant with signed Business Associate Agreements and SOC 2 Type II certified. All documents are encrypted with AES-256 in transit and at rest. Your data is never used to train AI models, and you have full control over data retention and deletion."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does Dodonai handle scanned medical records?",
      "answer": "Yes. Dodonai includes built-in {{link:/ai-pdf-ocr/|AI-powered OCR}} that extracts text from scanned PDFs and image-based documents. Many disability claimants' records arrive as scans from provider offices — you can upload them directly without running a separate OCR step first."
