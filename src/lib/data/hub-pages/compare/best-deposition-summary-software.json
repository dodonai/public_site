        "Your paralegal just spent eight hours on a single transcript. There's a faster way. The best deposition summary software should preserve the factual substance of testimony, provide accurate page-line citations, and deliver results fast enough to keep pace with litigation deadlines. These are the baseline requirements that separate useful tools from glorified text editors.",
        "Look for software that supports multiple output formats — a page-line summary of deposition testimony, a narrative overview, or an issue-based digest. The best {{link:/blog/how-to-draft-a-page-line-deposition-summary/|AI deposition summary}} tools offer all three from a single upload.",
        "Security and data privacy are non-negotiable. Deposition transcripts contain sensitive client information, attorney work product, and privileged communications. Any software you adopt should be SOC 2 certified and offer enterprise-grade encryption at rest and in transit.",
        "Finally, evaluate cost on a per-page or per-transcript basis rather than sticker price alone. Traditional deposition summary services charge $3 to $10 per page, which adds up on high-volume caseloads. AI-powered alternatives like {{link:/deposition-summary-software/|Dodonai}} -- the best AI deposition summary tool available today -- cut that cost while maintaining quality."

      "answer": "Yes. Enter key topics, issues, or witness names and the AI gives them additional emphasis while still capturing the full scope of testimony. You can also choose between {{link:/blog/how-to-draft-a-page-line-deposition-summary/|page-line}} and narrative formats."

    {
      "question": "Is my deposition transcript data secure?",

    {
      "question": "What file types does Dodonai accept for deposition transcripts?",
      "answer": "PDF, Word (.doc/.docx), text (.txt), CSV, and PowerPoint (.pptx). Most court reporters deliver in PDF or text format, both of which work seamlessly with Dodonai's {{link:/deposition-summary-software/|deposition summary software}}."

    {
      "question": "How does Dodonai compare to free AI tools like ChatGPT for deposition summaries?",
      "answer": "General-purpose AI tools lack page-line citations, can't produce formatted digests, and may use your transcripts for training. Dodonai was designed specifically for litigation teams — SOC 2 security, legal output formats, and deposition transcript handling built in."
