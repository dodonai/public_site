        "The best deposition summary software should do more than condense a transcript. It should preserve the factual substance of testimony, provide accurate page-line citations, and deliver results fast enough to keep pace with litigation deadlines. These are the baseline requirements that separate useful tools from glorified text editors.",
        "Look for software that supports multiple output formats, including {{link:/blog/how-to-draft-a-page-line-deposition-summary/|page-line summaries}} and narrative summaries. Format flexibility matters because different attorneys, judges, and case types call for different summary styles. A tool that locks you into a single format adds friction rather than removing it.",
        "Security and data privacy are non-negotiable. Deposition transcripts contain sensitive client information, attorney work product, and privileged communications. Any software you adopt should be SOC 2 certified and offer enterprise-grade encryption at rest and in transit.",
        "Finally, evaluate cost on a per-page or per-transcript basis rather than sticker price alone. Traditional deposition summary services charge $3 to $10 per page, which adds up quickly on high-volume caseloads. AI-powered alternatives like {{link:/deposition-summary-software/|Dodonai}} dramatically reduce that cost while maintaining quality."

    {
      "question": "What makes AI deposition summary software better than hiring a summary service?",
      "answer": "AI deposition summary software delivers results in minutes rather than days, at a fraction of the cost. Dodonai processes a typical transcript for under a dollar per page, compared to $3 to $10 per page from outsourced services. You also retain full control over turnaround time and can reprocess a transcript instantly if case priorities change."
    },
    {
      "question": "How accurate are AI-generated deposition summaries?",
      "answer": "Dodonai's AI summaries are reviewed by attorneys and consistently rated as comparable or superior to manually drafted summaries. Every summary includes page and line citations so you can verify any statement against the original transcript. We recommend a brief attorney review as a best practice, just as you would with a summary from any vendor."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I customize the summary output for my case?",
      "answer": "Yes. You can enter key topics, issues, or witness names that you want the summary to focus on. The AI will give additional emphasis to those areas throughout the summary while still capturing the full scope of testimony. You can also choose between {{link:/blog/how-to-draft-a-page-line-deposition-summary/|page-line}} and narrative output formats."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is my deposition transcript data secure?",
      "answer": "Dodonai is SOC 2 Type II certified and HIPAA compliant. All data is encrypted in transit and at rest using AES-256 encryption. Your documents are never used to train AI models, and you can delete your data at any time."
    },
    {
      "question": "What file types does Dodonai accept for deposition transcripts?",
      "answer": "Dodonai accepts PDF, Word (.doc and .docx), text (.txt), CSV, and PowerPoint (.pptx) files. Most court reporters deliver transcripts in PDF or text format, both of which work seamlessly with Dodonai's {{link:/deposition-summary-software/|deposition summary software}}."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Dodonai compare to free AI tools like ChatGPT for deposition summaries?",
      "answer": "General-purpose AI tools are not built for legal documents. They lack page-line citation support, cannot produce properly formatted deposition digests, and raise serious data privacy concerns since transcripts may be used for model training. Dodonai is purpose-built for litigation workflows with SOC 2 security, legal-specific output formats, and no data training."
