        "Eight hours on a single transcript. That's the reality for paralegals drafting summaries manually. The best deposition summary software generates a polished summary with accurate page-line citations fast enough to keep pace with litigation deadlines. That's the baseline that separates useful tools from glorified text editors.",
        "Look for software that supports multiple output formats: a page-line summary of deposition testimony, a narrative overview, or an issue-based digest. The best {{link:/blog/how-to-draft-a-page-line-deposition-summary/|AI deposition summary}} tools offer all three from a single upload.",
        "Security matters. Deposition transcripts contain client information, work product, and privileged communications. Look for SOC 2 certification and AES-256 encryption at minimum, and confirm the vendor doesn't use your transcripts for model training.",
        "Finally, evaluate cost on a per-page or per-transcript basis rather than sticker price alone. Traditional deposition summary services charge $3 to $10 per page, which adds up on high-volume caseloads. AI deposition summary tools like {{link:/deposition-summary-software/|Dodonai}} cut that cost while maintaining quality."

      "answer": "Speed and cost. Dodonai processes a typical transcript for under a dollar per page in minutes, compared to $3-$10 per page and 3-7 business days from outsourced services. You can also reprocess instantly if case priorities change."

      "answer": "Attorneys report that Dodonai's summaries are on par with manually drafted ones, with the added benefit of consistent formatting and instant availability. Every summary includes page-line citations so you can verify any statement against the original transcript."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I customize the summary output for my case?",
      "answer": "Yes. Enter key topics, issues, or witness names and the AI gives them additional emphasis while still capturing the full scope of testimony. You can also choose between {{link:/blog/how-to-draft-a-page-line-deposition-summary/|page-line}} and narrative formats."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is my deposition transcript data secure?",
      "answer": "Your transcripts stay encrypted (AES-256) from the moment they leave your machine. We hold SOC 2 certification, sign BAAs on every account, and are fully HIPAA compliant. Nothing you upload ever trains our models, and deletion is on your timeline, not ours."

    {
      "question": "Where can I see a deposition summary example?",
      "answer": "Sign up for a free trial and upload any transcript. You'll get a complete deposition summary example with page-line citations in about 3 minutes. You can also review a {{link:/blog/how-to-draft-a-page-line-deposition-summary/|step-by-step walkthrough}} showing exactly what the output looks like."
    },
    {
      "question": "What file types does Dodonai accept for deposition transcripts?",
      "answer": "PDF, Word (.doc/.docx), text (.txt), CSV, and PowerPoint (.pptx). Most court reporters deliver in PDF or text format, both of which work with Dodonai's {{link:/deposition-summary-software/|deposition summary software}}."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Dodonai compare to free AI tools like ChatGPT for deposition summaries?",
      "answer": "General-purpose AI tools can't produce page-line citations, don't generate formatted digests, and most use your uploads for training. Dodonai was purpose-built for litigation with SOC 2 security, legal output formats, and deposition transcript handling built into the product from the start."
