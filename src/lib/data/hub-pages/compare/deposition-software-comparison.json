        "A deposition software comparison starts with two questions: does it produce accurate deposition summaries with reliable page-line citations, and does it make testimony searchable across your full case library? The best tools do both while keeping citation integrity intact. When evaluating options, focus on output quality, turnaround speed, cost per page, security certifications, and whether the software supports both {{link:/deposition-summary-software/|summary generation}} and {{link:/ai-deposition-transcript-software/|transcript search and management}}.",

      "question": "How do I choose between AI deposition software and a traditional summary service?",
      "answer": "It comes down to turnaround and cost. If you need summaries in hours at under $1/page, AI software like Dodonai fits. If you prefer a fully human-reviewed product and can wait 3-7 days, traditional services work. Many firms use AI for routine depositions and reserve traditional services for expert witnesses."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use ChatGPT or other general AI tools for deposition summaries?",
      "answer": "General-purpose tools can't produce page-line citations, lack legal formatting, and most use your uploads for training. Dodonai is purpose-built for deposition processing with legal output formats and SOC 2 security."
    },
    {
      "question": "What deposition summary formats does Dodonai support?",
      "answer": "Page-line summaries, narrative summaries, and {{link:/blog/how-to-draft-a-issue-based-deposition-summary/|issue-based summaries}}. Generate any format from the same upload, and each includes citations that link back to the original testimony."
    },
    {
      "question": "How accurate are AI-generated deposition summaries compared to human-drafted summaries?",
      "answer": "Dodonai's output matches the quality attorneys expect from manual summaries, with the added benefit of consistent formatting across every transcript. Every summary includes page-line citations for verification, and we recommend a brief attorney review as standard practice."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is my deposition transcript data secure with AI software?",
      "answer": "Privileged transcripts need SOC 2, HIPAA, and encryption at minimum. Dodonai meets all three: SOC 2 certified, HIPAA compliant, AES-256 encrypted. BAAs on every account. No training on your files, and you control when they're removed."

    {
      "question": "How does Dodonai compare to the best deposition summary software options?",
