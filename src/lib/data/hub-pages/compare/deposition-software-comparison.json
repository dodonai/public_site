        "Deposition software serves two core functions: summarizing transcripts and making testimony searchable. The best deposition tools do both well while maintaining the accuracy and citation integrity that litigation demands. When evaluating options, focus on output quality, turnaround speed, cost per page, security certifications, and whether the software supports both {{link:/deposition-summary-software/|summary generation}} and {{link:/ai-deposition-transcript-software/|transcript search and management}}.",
        "The deposition software landscape includes four main categories: purpose-built AI tools like Dodonai, traditional outsourced summary services, manual in-house summarization, and general-purpose AI chatbots. Each approach has trade-offs in cost, speed, accuracy, and security. The right choice depends on your firm's volume, budget, and how much control you want over turnaround time.",
        "Below, we compare these four approaches across the capabilities that matter most to litigation teams — from processing speed and cost to security compliance and output format flexibility."

    {
      "question": "How do I choose between AI deposition software and a traditional summary service?",
      "answer": "The decision usually comes down to turnaround time and cost. If you need summaries within hours rather than days and want to reduce per-page costs from $3-$10 down to under $1, AI deposition software like Dodonai is the better fit. If you prefer a fully human-reviewed product and are comfortable with multi-day turnaround, traditional services may work. Many firms use AI software for routine depositions and reserve traditional services for expert witness or particularly complex testimony."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use ChatGPT or other general AI tools for deposition summaries?",
      "answer": "General-purpose AI tools are not designed for legal document processing. They cannot produce properly formatted page-line citations, lack support for legal summary conventions, and raise serious data privacy concerns — most general AI tools use uploaded content for model training. Dodonai is purpose-built for deposition processing with legal-specific output formats, accurate citations, and SOC 2 certified security."
    },
    {
      "question": "What deposition summary formats does Dodonai support?",
      "answer": "Dodonai supports page-line summaries (also called deposition digests), narrative summaries, and {{link:/blog/how-to-draft-a-issue-based-deposition-summary/|issue-based summaries}}. You can generate any format from the same uploaded transcript and switch between formats without re-uploading. Each format includes page and line citations that link back to the original testimony."
    },
    {
      "question": "How accurate are AI-generated deposition summaries compared to human-drafted summaries?",
      "answer": "Dodonai's AI summaries are consistently rated by attorneys as comparable or superior to manually drafted summaries in terms of accuracy and completeness. Every summary includes page-line citations for verification. We recommend a brief attorney review as standard practice, just as you would review work from any summary vendor or paralegal."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is my deposition transcript data secure with AI software?",
      "answer": "With Dodonai, yes. The platform is SOC 2 Type II certified and HIPAA compliant. All data is encrypted using AES-256 in transit and at rest. Your transcripts are never used to train AI models, and you can delete your data at any time. This level of security is critical for deposition transcripts that may contain privileged attorney-client communications or confidential settlement discussions."

    {
      "question": "How does Dodonai compare to the best deposition summary software options?",
      "answer": "We have a detailed breakdown in our {{link:/compare/best-deposition-summary-software/|best deposition summary software}} comparison. In summary, Dodonai offers the fastest turnaround time, the lowest per-page cost, the most flexible output formats, and enterprise-grade security.
