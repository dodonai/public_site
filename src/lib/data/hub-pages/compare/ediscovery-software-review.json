        "Opposing counsel just produced 50,000 documents and the review deadline is three weeks out. Your choice of eDiscovery software decides whether your team finds the critical evidence or drowns in keyword-only search results with production bottlenecks.",
        "Search quality is the most important capability to evaluate. Traditional eDiscovery platforms rely on keyword and Boolean search — you only find documents containing your exact terms. AI-native electronic discovery platforms like {{link:/electronic-discovery-software/|Dodonai}} use semantic search to find documents based on meaning, catching synonyms, paraphrased concepts, and contextual references that keyword search misses. That's often where the strongest evidence lives.",
        "Cost is the other make-or-break factor. Legacy platforms from vendors like Relativity and Everlaw require annual contracts starting at $50,000+, plus per-gigabyte hosting fees. For solo practitioners, small firms, and mid-size teams, those numbers are prohibitive. AI-native eDiscovery software puts the same search capability within reach for any practice size."

    {
      "question": "How does semantic search differ from keyword search in eDiscovery?",
      "answer": "Keyword search returns only exact-match documents. Semantic search understands meaning, so searching 'employee safety complaints' also surfaces 'worker injury reports' and 'staff health concerns' -- results keyword search misses."

    {
      "question": "Can Dodonai replace a full eDiscovery platform like Relativity or Everlaw?",
      "answer": "For many firms, yes. Dodonai covers document ingestion, semantic and keyword search, AI review, and production export. For cases needing predictive coding workflows, it can complement a legacy platform for search and review."

    {
      "question": "What does eDiscovery cost with Dodonai compared to legacy platforms?",
      "answer": "Dodonai runs $30-$100/month depending on volume, with Enterprise pricing available. Legacy platforms start at $50,000+/year plus per-gigabyte hosting fees. For small and mid-size firms, that's a 90%+ cost reduction."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Dodonai secure enough for litigation document review?",
      "answer": "SOC 2 Type II certified, HIPAA compliant, BAAs signed on every account. AES-256 encryption in transit and at rest. Your documents never touch a training pipeline, and you set the retention rules."

    {

    },
    {
      "question": "How long does it take to set up Dodonai for eDiscovery?",
      "answer": "Minutes. There's no installation, no database configuration, no training period. Upload your documents and the platform indexes everything automatically."
