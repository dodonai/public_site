        "Choosing eDiscovery software is one of the most consequential technology decisions a litigation team can make. The right platform accelerates document review, reduces costs, and helps attorneys find the evidence that matters. The wrong one locks you into expensive contracts, buries critical documents in keyword-only search results, and creates bottlenecks during production deadlines.",
        "The most important capability to evaluate is search quality. Traditional eDiscovery platforms rely on keyword and Boolean search, which means you only find documents that contain the exact terms you specify. AI-native platforms like {{link:/electronic-discovery-software/|Dodonai}} use semantic search to find documents based on meaning, not just matching words. This catches relevant documents that keyword search misses — synonyms, paraphrased concepts, and contextual references that are often the most important evidence in a case.",
        "Cost is the other critical factor. Legacy eDiscovery platforms from vendors like Relativity, Everlaw, and Nuix typically require annual contracts starting at $50,000 or more, plus per-gigabyte hosting fees and additional charges for analytics features. For solo practitioners, small firms, and mid-size litigation teams, these costs are prohibitive. AI-native alternatives offer comparable or superior functionality at monthly price points that make eDiscovery accessible to any practice."

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How does semantic search differ from keyword search in eDiscovery?",
      "answer": "Keyword search only returns documents containing the exact terms you enter. Semantic search understands the meaning behind your query and finds documents that discuss the same concepts using different words. For example, searching for 'employee safety complaints' with semantic search will also surface documents about 'worker injury reports' or 'staff health concerns' — results that keyword search would miss entirely."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Dodonai replace a full eDiscovery platform like Relativity or Everlaw?",
      "answer": "For many firms, yes. Dodonai provides the core eDiscovery capabilities that most litigation teams need: document ingestion, semantic and keyword search, AI-powered review and summarization, and export for production. For cases that require specialized features like predictive coding workflows or complex production templating, Dodonai can serve as a cost-effective complement to a legacy platform for the search and review phases."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does eDiscovery cost with Dodonai compared to legacy platforms?",
      "answer": "Dodonai plans range from $30 per month (Lite, 200 credits) to $100 per month (Pro, 5,000 credits), with Enterprise pricing available for higher volumes. Legacy eDiscovery platforms typically start at $50,000 or more per year, plus per-gigabyte hosting fees of $5 to $25 per month. For small and mid-size firms, Dodonai can reduce eDiscovery costs by 90% or more."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Dodonai secure enough for litigation document review?",
      "answer": "Yes. Dodonai is SOC 2 Type II certified and HIPAA compliant. All documents are encrypted with AES-256 in transit and at rest. Your data is never used to train AI models. These are the same security standards that enterprise eDiscovery platforms provide, available at every Dodonai plan level."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Dodonai handle scanned documents in an eDiscovery collection?",
      "answer": "Yes. Dodonai includes {{link:/ai-pdf-ocr/|AI-powered OCR}} that extracts text from scanned PDFs, faxed documents, and image-based files. You can upload mixed collections of native text and scanned documents, and everything becomes searchable and summarizable without a separate OCR step."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does it take to set up Dodonai for eDiscovery?",
      "answer": "You can start uploading and searching documents within minutes of creating an account. There is no installation, no database configuration, and no training period required. Upload your document collection, and Dodonai's AI indexes and processes everything automatically."
