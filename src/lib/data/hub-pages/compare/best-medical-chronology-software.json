        "A plaintiff's records span 2,000 pages across a dozen providers, and trial is six weeks out. That's the scenario where medical records chronology software earns its keep. It automates the extraction of dates, providers, diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes from medical records and arranges them into a structured timeline -- essential for personal injury, medical malpractice, and disability cases.",
        "Without dedicated software, building a medical chronology is one of the most time-consuming tasks in case preparation. Manually sorting that information into a usable format often takes a paralegal or nurse reviewer days or even weeks.",
        "The best medical chronology software goes beyond simple extraction. It should link each entry to the exact source page, handle scanned and OCR'd documents, and allow filtering by provider, date range, or event type. These capabilities let your team spend less time organizing records and more time analyzing them for case strategy.",
        "Dodonai's {{link:/ai-medical-record-summaries-chronologies/|AI medical record summarization}} tool generates both a narrative medical record summary and a detailed legal medical chronology with page references for quick verification, all within minutes of uploading the records."
