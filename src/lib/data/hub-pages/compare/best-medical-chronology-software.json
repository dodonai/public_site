        "Medical chronology software automates the process of extracting dates, providers, diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes from medical records and arranging them into a structured timeline. For litigation teams handling personal injury, medical malpractice, or disability cases, this timeline is essential for understanding a patient's medical journey and identifying gaps or inconsistencies in care.",
        "Without dedicated software, building a medical chronology is one of the most time-consuming tasks in case preparation. A single plaintiff's records can span thousands of pages across dozens of providers, and manually sorting that information into a usable format often takes a paralegal or nurse reviewer days or even weeks.",
        "The best medical chronology software goes beyond simple extraction. It should link each chronology entry back to its source page, handle scanned and OCR'd documents, and allow filtering by provider, date range, or event type. These capabilities let your team spend less time organizing records and more time analyzing them for case strategy.",
        "Dodonai's {{link:/ai-medical-record-summaries-chronologies/|AI medical record summarization}} tool generates both a narrative summary of the patient's healthcare history and a detailed chronology with source-linked citations, all within minutes of uploading the records."

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What is medical chronology software?",
      "answer": "Medical chronology software automatically extracts key medical events from patient records and arranges them into a date-ordered timeline. This gives attorneys and paralegals a clear view of the patient's treatment history without manually reading through hundreds or thousands of pages of records."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is AI medical chronology software different from a record review service?",
      "answer": "A record review service uses human reviewers (often nurses or paralegals) to manually read and summarize medical records, which typically takes 5 to 10 business days. AI medical chronology software like Dodonai automates this process and delivers results in minutes at a fraction of the cost. Both produce usable chronologies, but AI gives you speed and cost advantages."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Dodonai handle scanned medical records?",
      "answer": "Yes. Dodonai includes built-in {{link:/ai-pdf-ocr/|AI-powered OCR}} that processes scanned PDFs and image-based documents. You do not need to run records through a separate OCR tool before uploading them."
    },
    {
      "question": "What output formats are available for medical chronologies?",
      "answer": "Dodonai supports PDF, Word (.docx), Excel (.xls), and text (.txt) downloads. You can also view and interact with the chronology directly in the browser using the side-by-side viewer with source linking. Learn more about {{link:/blog/medical-chronology-vs-narrative-summary-which-format-fits-your-case-prep/|choosing between chronology and narrative formats}}."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is patient data safe when using AI summarization software?",
      "answer": "Dodonai is HIPAA compliant with signed Business Associate Agreements, SOC 2 Type II certified, and uses AES-256 encryption for all data. Your medical records are never used to train AI models, and you retain full control over data retention and deletion."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does medical chronology software cost compared to manual review?",
      "answer": "Dodonai plans start at $30 per month for 200 pages. By contrast, outsourced medical record review services typically charge $5 to $15 per page, and manual review by in-house staff is billed at the paralegal or nurse hourly rate. For firms with recurring volume, the savings compound quickly."
