        "A plaintiff's records span 2,000 pages across a dozen providers, and trial is six weeks out. Medical chronology software automates the extraction of dates, providers, diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes from those records and arranges them into a structured timeline — essential for personal injury, medical malpractice, and disability cases.",
        "Without it, building a medical chronology is one of the most time-consuming tasks in case prep. Manually sorting that information into a usable format takes a paralegal or nurse reviewer days, sometimes weeks.",
        "The best medical chronology software goes beyond simple extraction. It should link each entry to the exact source page, handle scanned and OCR'd documents, and allow filtering by provider, date range, or event type. With sorting, filtering, and source-page linking, your team moves from raw records to case-ready analysis in a fraction of the time.",
        "Dodonai's {{link:/ai-medical-record-summaries-chronologies/|AI medical record summarization}} tool generates both a narrative medical record summary and a detailed legal medical chronology with page references for quick verification, all within minutes of uploading the records."

    },
    {
      "question": "How is AI medical chronology software different from a record review service?",
      "answer": "Record review services use human reviewers and typically take 5-10 business days. AI medical chronology software like Dodonai delivers results in minutes at under $0.15 per page — versus $5-$15 per page from review services."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Dodonai handle scanned medical records?",
      "answer": "Yes. Built-in {{link:/ai-pdf-ocr/|AI-powered OCR}} processes scanned PDFs and image-based documents -- no separate OCR step needed."
    },
    {
      "question": "What output formats are available for medical chronologies?",
      "answer": "PDF, Word (.docx), Excel (.xls), and text (.txt). You can also interact with the chronology in the browser using the side-by-side viewer. Learn more about {{link:/blog/medical-chronology-vs-narrative-summary-which-format-fits-your-case-prep/|choosing between chronology and narrative formats}} — many firms use the Excel export as a reusable medical chronology template across similar cases."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is patient data safe when using AI summarization software?",
      "answer": "Patient records never leave an encrypted environment. Dodonai holds SOC 2 Type II certification and signs BAAs for HIPAA coverage. Your data doesn't train our models. When you're done with a file, delete it — we don't keep copies."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does medical chronology software cost compared to manual review?",
      "answer": "Dodonai starts at $30/month for 200 pages. Outsourced services charge $5-$15 per page, and in-house staff is billed at hourly rates. For firms with recurring volume, Dodonai pays for itself within the first case or two."
