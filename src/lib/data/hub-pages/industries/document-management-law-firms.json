      "paragraphs": [
        "Every law firm has a document management problem, and it's not about storage. You've got no trouble saving files to shared drives, case management platforms, or cloud folders. The problem is that the documents sitting in those systems are unprocessed — unread transcripts, unsummarized medical records, scanned files that aren't searchable, discovery productions nobody has time to review page by page.",
        "The documents are stored. The information inside them isn't accessible.",
        "Legal document management software — real document management for law firms, not just file storage — should close that gap. Dodonai processes the content of every document you upload instead of treating files as static objects retrieved by filename. Medical records become structured chronologies. Deposition transcripts become searchable, cited summaries. Scanned PDFs become readable text through {{link:/ai-pdf-ocr/|AI-powered OCR}}. Discovery productions become filterable, reviewable datasets.",
        "Attorneys and paralegals shift from reading raw files to reviewing structured outputs. A 500-page record set that takes a full day of manual review is processed in under 15 minutes at a fraction of vendor costs. Work product quality goes up because AI-generated outputs include references to the original documents — every data point is verifiable."

    {
      "question": "Does Dodonai replace our existing document management system?",
      "answer": "No — Dodonai is a processing layer that sits alongside your existing DMS. You keep using your current system for storage and access control. Dodonai handles the AI-powered summarization, search, and extraction, and you save the structured outputs back into your system."
    },
    {
      "question": "What types of documents can Dodonai process?",
      "answer": "Deposition transcripts, medical records, discovery productions, contracts, pleadings, expert reports, and more. The {{link:/ai-pdf-ocr/|AI OCR}} feature handles scanned documents, faxed records, and image-only PDFs."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Dodonai handle document security and confidentiality?",
      "answer": "Dodonai is a processing layer, not a storage layer — but we treat security the same way your DMS does. SOC 2 Type II certified with signed BAAs and AES-256 encryption across the board. Documents you upload never enter a training pipeline. Your firm decides when files are deleted."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can multiple people at the firm use the same account?",
      "answer": "Yes. Dodonai supports team accounts with a shared credit pool. Plans are based on page volume, not user seats, so adding team members doesn't increase cost."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Dodonai compare to traditional document management systems like iManage or NetDocuments?",
      "answer": "Traditional DMS platforms handle storage and access control. Dodonai handles what comes after — AI summarization, OCR, search, and extraction. The two are complementary. See our {{link:/industries/law-firm-case-management/|case management page}} for more on the workflow."
