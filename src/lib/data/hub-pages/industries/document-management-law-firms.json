      "paragraphs": [
        "Every law firm has a document management problem, and it isn't about storage. Firms have no trouble saving files to shared drives, case management platforms, or cloud folders. The problem is that the documents sitting in those systems are largely unprocessed — unread transcripts, unsummarized medical records, scanned files that aren't searchable, and discovery productions that no one has time to review page by page.",
        "The documents are stored, but the information inside them is not accessible.",
        "Intelligent document management for attorneys closes that gap. Instead of treating documents as static files to be retrieved by filename, Dodonai processes the content of every document you upload. Medical records become structured chronologies. Deposition transcripts become searchable, cited summaries. Scanned PDFs become fully readable text through {{link:/ai-pdf-ocr/|AI-powered OCR}}. Discovery productions become filterable, reviewable datasets.",
        "For litigation teams, this means attorneys and paralegals spend less time reading and more time analyzing. Case preparation timelines compress. And work product quality improves because AI-generated outputs include references pointing back to the original documents, so every data point is verifiable."
