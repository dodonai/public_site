      "paragraphs": [
        "Every law firm has a document management problem, and it isn't about storage. Firms have no trouble saving files to shared drives, case management platforms, or cloud folders. The problem is that the documents sitting in those systems are largely unprocessed — unread transcripts, unsummarized medical records, scanned files that aren't searchable, and discovery productions that no one has time to review page by page. The documents are stored, but the information inside them is not accessible.",
        "AI-powered document management changes this equation. Instead of treating documents as static files to be stored and retrieved by filename, Dodonai processes the content of every document you upload. Medical records become structured chronologies. Deposition transcripts become searchable, cited summaries. Scanned PDFs become fully readable text through {{link:/ai-pdf-ocr/|AI-powered OCR}}. Discovery productions become filterable, reviewable datasets. The information locked inside your documents becomes organized, searchable, and immediately useful.",
        "For litigation teams, this changes how document-heavy work gets done. Attorneys and paralegals spend less time reading and more time analyzing. Case preparation timelines compress. And work product quality improves because AI-generated outputs include source-linked citations back to the original documents, so every data point is verifiable."

      "question": "Does Dodonai replace our existing document management system?",
      "answer": "No. Dodonai is a document processing layer that works alongside your existing DMS, case management platform, or cloud storage system. You continue to use your current system for file storage, access control, and organization. Dodonai handles the AI-powered processing — summarization, OCR, search, and extraction — and delivers structured outputs that you save back into your existing system."
    },
    {
      "question": "What types of documents can Dodonai process?",
      "answer": "Dodonai processes deposition transcripts, medical records, discovery productions, contracts, correspondence, pleadings, expert reports, and virtually any other PDF or Word document used in litigation. The {{link:/ai-pdf-ocr/|AI OCR}} feature handles scanned documents, faxed records, and image-only PDFs, so you can upload files in any format you receive them."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Dodonai handle document security and confidentiality?",
      "answer": "Dodonai is SOC 2 Type II certified and HIPAA compliant. All documents are encrypted in transit and at rest using AES-256 encryption. Your data is never used to train AI models, and you retain full control over data retention and deletion. We execute Business Associate Agreements for firms handling protected health information."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can multiple people at the firm use the same account?",
      "answer": "Yes. Dodonai supports team accounts where attorneys, paralegals, and staff share a single credit pool. Administrators can manage team access and monitor usage. Plans are based on page volume, not user seats, so adding team members doesn't increase your cost."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Dodonai compare to traditional document management systems like iManage or NetDocuments?",
      "answer": "Traditional DMS platforms focus on file storage, version control, and access management. Dodonai focuses on what happens after a document is stored — processing the content through AI summarization, OCR, search, and extraction. The two systems are complementary. Dodonai processes your documents and delivers structured outputs that you save into your DMS for organized, searchable access. See our {{link:/industries/law-firm-case-management/|law firm case management page}} for more on how Dodonai fits into existing workflows."
