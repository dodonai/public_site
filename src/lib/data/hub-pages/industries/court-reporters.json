        "Every deposition transcript you deliver creates downstream work for the attorney: reading, marking key passages, and drafting summaries. Most firms outsource that work to deposition summary services at $3 to $10 per page, or assign it to a paralegal for 6-8 hours. Either way, it happens after you hand off the transcript. That's revenue you could capture instead.",
        "Dodonai is deposition transcript software that lets you offer a complete {{link:/deposition-summary-software/|deposition summary}} alongside your certified transcript. Upload the finished file and generate a page-line summary with citations in about 3 minutes per 100 pages. Offer {{link:/ai-deposition-transcript-software/|transcript management software}} so attorneys can search testimony by topic or witness instead of scrolling through hundreds of pages. Both services deliver under your brand as a premium add-on.",
        "Your processing cost on annual plans is less than $0.01 per page. Attorneys currently pay $3 to $10 per page for the same work from outsourced vendors. Price your deposition summary service at $1 to $3 per page and you're saving clients money while keeping a healthy margin on every transcript.",

      "answer": "After you produce the certified transcript, upload it to Dodonai. The AI generates a deposition summary with page-line citations in minutes. Download the summary and deliver it to the attorney alongside the transcript as a premium service."
    },
    {
      "question": "What types of summaries can I offer attorneys?",
      "answer": "Page-line summaries (citation tables organized by page and line number), narrative summaries (flowing prose overviews of the testimony), and topic-focused digests that highlight specific issues. All formats include page-line references back to the original transcript."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much can I charge for AI-generated summaries?",
      "answer": "That's up to you. Most court reporters offering summaries price them at $1 to $3 per page. With Dodonai processing for less than $0.01 per page on annual plans, the margin is significant. A 200-page deposition that costs you under $2 to process can be priced at $200 to $600 to the attorney."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will attorneys trust AI-generated summaries from a court reporter?",
      "answer": "Every summary includes page-line citations the attorney can verify against the certified transcript. You're the trusted source for the transcript itself, which makes you the natural provider for summaries derived from it. Attorneys already pay $3 to $10 per page for outsourced summaries; getting them from the same vendor, faster and cheaper, is an easy decision."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to review every summary before sending it to the attorney?",
      "answer": "We recommend a quick review, especially when starting out. The AI handles extraction and formatting accurately, but a 5-minute scan of a 200-page summary ensures the output meets your quality standards before it goes to the attorney."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is transcript data secure on Dodonai?",
      "answer": "Deposition transcripts often contain privileged and confidential testimony. AES-256 encryption protects every file from upload through deletion. SOC 2 Type II certified infrastructure with signed BAAs. Your transcripts never train our models, and you control when files are removed."
