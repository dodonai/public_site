        "Case management is fundamentally a document management problem. Every case involves gathering records, organizing evidence, summarizing testimony, tracking deadlines, and producing work product. The firms that process documents faster gain a measurable advantage in case throughput, cost control, and client outcomes.",
        "Most case management platforms handle the organizational layer — contacts, calendars, tasks, and file storage. But they leave the actual document processing to your team. Someone still has to read through a 300-page deposition transcript, summarize a plaintiff's medical records, extract key data from discovery documents, and format everything for attorney review. This is where the majority of paralegal and associate time goes, and it is where AI delivers the greatest return.",
        "Dodonai plugs into your existing case management workflow as the document processing layer. Upload files from your case management system, and Dodonai returns structured outputs — {{link:/deposition-summary-software/|deposition summaries}}, {{link:/ai-medical-record-summaries-chronologies/|medical chronologies}}, {{link:/ai-deposition-transcript-software/|searchable transcripts}}, and {{link:/dodonai-extract-and-draft-agents/|custom extracts}} — that your team can drop directly into case files, demand letters, discovery responses, and trial binders.",
        "This is not a replacement for your case management platform. It is the processing engine that makes everything inside your case management system more useful, more organized, and more accessible."
