        "Your case management software tracks deadlines, contacts, and tasks — but it doesn't read a 300-page deposition or summarize a plaintiff's medical records. That work still falls on your team.",
        "Most law firm case management software handles the organizational layer — contacts, calendars, tasks, and file storage. But the actual document processing happens manually. Someone still has to read the transcript, summarize the records, extract key data from discovery, and format everything for attorney review. That manual work absorbs the majority of paralegal and associate hours, and it's where AI delivers the greatest return.",
        "Dodonai plugs into your existing workflow as the document processing layer. Upload files from your case management system, and Dodonai returns structured outputs — {{link:/deposition-summary-software/|deposition summaries}}, {{link:/ai-medical-record-summaries-chronologies/|medical chronologies}}, {{link:/ai-deposition-transcript-software/|searchable transcripts}}, and {{link:/dodonai-extract-and-draft-agents/|custom extracts}} — that your team can drop directly into case files, demand letters, discovery responses, and trial binders.",
        "Dodonai doesn't replace your case management platform — it's the processing engine that turns a 300-page deposition into a structured summary in 3 minutes and a 500-page medical record set into an organized chronology in under 15."
