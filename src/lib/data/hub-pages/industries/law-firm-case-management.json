        "Your case management platform tracks deadlines, contacts, and tasks — but it doesn't read a 300-page deposition or summarize a plaintiff's medical records. That work still falls on your team.",
        "Most platforms handle the organizational layer — contacts, calendars, tasks, and file storage. But the actual legal case file processing happens manually. Someone still has to read the transcript, summarize the records, extract key data from discovery, and format everything for attorney review. This is where the majority of paralegal and associate time goes, and where AI delivers the greatest return.",
        "Dodonai plugs into your existing workflow as the document processing layer. Upload files from your case management system, and Dodonai returns structured outputs — {{link:/deposition-summary-software/|deposition summaries}}, {{link:/ai-medical-record-summaries-chronologies/|medical chronologies}}, {{link:/ai-deposition-transcript-software/|searchable transcripts}}, and {{link:/dodonai-extract-and-draft-agents/|custom extracts}} — that your team can drop directly into case files, demand letters, discovery responses, and trial binders.",
