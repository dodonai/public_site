        "IME companies operate under constant pressure to deliver thorough, timely medical evaluations. Before a physician can conduct an examination, someone on the team must review the claimant's complete medical history — often hundreds of pages of clinical notes, imaging reports, lab results, and specialist correspondence. This pre-exam record review is a bottleneck that drives up costs and delays turnaround times.",
        "Traditional approaches to IME medical record summarization rely on in-house staff or outsourced review services, both of which struggle with consistency and scalability. When volume spikes, quality drops or deadlines slip. When you hire more reviewers, training and oversight costs climb. The fundamental problem is that manual record review doesn't scale efficiently.",
        "Dodonai's {{link:/ai-medical-record-summaries-chronologies/|AI medical record summarization platform}} eliminates this bottleneck. It automates the extraction and organization of key medical data, giving IME physicians a structured, chronological summary they can review in minutes before each examination — faster turnaround, lower per-case costs, and consistency that manual processes can't match."
