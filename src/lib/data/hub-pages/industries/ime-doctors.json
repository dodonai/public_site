      "question": "How long does it take to summarize a typical IME record set?",
      "answer": "Most record sets are summarized in minutes, regardless of size. A 500-page case file and a 50-page file are processed at the same speed — you're not waiting hours for results."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the AI handle handwritten physician notes and poor-quality scans?",
      "answer": "Yes. Dodonai's {{link:/ai-pdf-ocr/|AI OCR engine}} processes handwritten notes, scanned documents, and faxed records. It extracts text from low-quality images so nothing clinically relevant is missed."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I customize the summary to focus on specific injuries or body systems?",
      "answer": "Yes. You can specify focus areas — body systems, date ranges, providers, or injury types — so the summary highlights what's most relevant to your evaluation."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I verify the AI's output against the original records?",
      "answer": "Every finding in the summary links back to its source page in the original document. Click any data point to see the exact page it came from."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does it cost?",
      "answer": "Per-page pricing with no minimums or seat fees. Visit our {{link:/pricing/|pricing page}} for current rates."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the platform HIPAA compliant?",
      "answer": "IME records contain claimant PHI that falls under strict federal and state privacy rules. We sign a BAA before your first upload, encrypt everything with AES-256, and hold SOC 2 Type II certification. Your records never enter any training pipeline — and you choose when they're deleted."
