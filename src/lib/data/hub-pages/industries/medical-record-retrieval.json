        "The medical record retrieval industry has become increasingly commoditized. Law firms, insurance companies, and {{link:/industries/ime-companies/|IME providers}} can choose from dozens of retrieval services, and competition often comes down to turnaround time and price.",
        "For retrieval companies looking to grow margins and deepen client relationships, the opportunity lies in higher-value services on top of the records you already deliver.",
        "AI-powered medical record retrieval and summarization is the most natural extension of a retrieval business. Your clients already need their records summarized — they either do it in-house, outsource it to a separate vendor, or use software directly. By integrating {{link:/ai-medical-record-summaries-chronologies/|AI summarization}} into your offering, you capture that revenue instead of leaving it on the table.",
        "Dodonai makes this transition seamless. Our platform processes the same records you already retrieve, generating structured summaries and chronologies your clients can use immediately. No need to hire medical reviewers or build technology from scratch — Dodonai handles the AI, and you deliver the finished product under your own brand."
