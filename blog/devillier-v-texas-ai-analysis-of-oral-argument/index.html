<h3><strong>ROBERTS</strong></h3>
<p><strong>1. The Justice takes interest in the following issues:<br/></strong>   - The interpretation of the Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause and its application to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment.<br/>
              - The distinction between a substantive right and a cause of action.<br/>
              - The procedural aspects of the case, including the removal of the case to federal court and the potential for a state to cease a taking after the fact.<br/>
              - The role of the state and federal courts in enforcing the Takings Clause.</p>
<p><strong>2. Summary of the Justice's questions and the attorneys' responses:<br/></strong>   - To Mr. McNamara (for the petitioners), the Justice asked about the potential for a state to cease a taking after it has been determined to be a taking and the state has been ordered to pay compensation. Mr. McNamara responded that a state could cease a taking, but that would create an uncompensated temporary taking.<br/>
              - To Mr. Nielson (for the respondent), the Justice asked about the interpretation of previous Supreme Court cases that stated the Constitution provides a basis for a court to award money damages against the government. Mr. Nielson argued that these cases were about the substantive right, not a cause of action.<br/>
              - To Mr. Kneedler (for the United States, as amicus curiae), the Justice asked about the government's argument in First English that the Constitution does not of its own force furnish a basis for a court to award money damages against the government. Mr. Kneedler argued that the Constitution speaks in terms of compensation in defining the right, not in providing a cause of action.</p>
<p><strong>3. Analysis of the Justice's sentiment towards each issue:<br/></strong>   - The Justice seems to lean towards the interpretation that the Constitution does provide a basis for a court to award money damages against the government, as indicated by his questions to Mr. Nielson and Mr. Kneedler.<br/>
              - The Justice appears to be interested in the procedural aspects of the case, particularly the potential for a state to cease a taking after the fact, as indicated by his questions to Mr. McNamara.</p>
<p><strong>4. Analysis of the Justice's sentiment towards each party's position:<br/></strong>   - The Justice seems to be skeptical of the respondent's and the United States' arguments that the Constitution does not provide a cause of action for takings claims against the state.<br/>

              - To Mr. Nielson, the Justice asks about the potential cause of action and whether the petitioners' constitutional right can be vindicated in Texas courts. Mr. Nielson points to the Texas Supreme Court's decision in City of Baytown and suggests that the petitioners could amend their complaint to bring a claim under Texas common law.</p>

              - The Justice asked Mr. Nielson about a hypothetical scenario where a state refuses to provide any form of remedy for a taking. Mr. Nielson suggested that in such a scenario, the property owner could seek an injunction or ask Congress to enforce the right through legislation.<br/>

<p><strong>2. Summary of the Justice's questions and the attorneys' responses:<br/></strong>   - To Mr. McNamara, the Justice questioned the existence of an independent cause of action under the Fifth Amendment and the nature of the remedy. Mr. McNamara argued that the Fifth Amendment does provide a cause of action and an entitlement to just compensation as a remedy. The Justice also questioned the role of state common law, to which Mr. McNamara conceded that a state common law action could vindicate the Fifth Amendment.<br/>
              - To Mr. Nielson, the Justice questioned the potential for states to withdraw compensation schemes. Mr. Nielson argued that Texas provides compensation and that the state has a constitutional right to do so. The Justice also asked about the existing state constitutional and common law causes of action, which Mr. Nielson confirmed exist but were not pled in this case.<br/>
              - To Mr. Kneedler, the Justice asked about the potential for states to act as "rogue states" and withdraw compensation schemes. Mr. Kneedler argued that this is a fundamental aspect of the Constitution and that injunctive action could be taken if necessary.</p>
<p><strong>3. Analysis of the Justice's sentiment towards each issue:<br/></strong>   - The Justice seems skeptical about the existence of an independent cause of action under the Fifth Amendment, suggesting that the remedy might be found in state common law.<br/>

              - The Justice seems to agree with Mr. Nielson's argument that Texas provides compensation and has a constitutional right to do so, but questions why the existing state constitutional and common law causes of action were not pled in this case.<br/>
              - The Justice appears to agree with Mr. Kneedler's argument that the potential for states to act as "rogue states" is a fundamental aspect of the Constitution, but questions whether the existing state constitutional cause of action is still available to the plaintiffs.  </p>

McNamara responded that they are not distinct concepts and that a cause of action is an entitlement to a particular remedy.<br/>
