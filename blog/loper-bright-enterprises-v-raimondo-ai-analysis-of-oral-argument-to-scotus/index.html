<h3>OPENINGS</h3>
<p>The petitioner's attorney, Mr. Clement, focuses on the challenges imposed by the Chevron doctrine, particularly its impact on small businesses and individuals. He emphasizes the burden faced by his clients, small-scale commercial fishers, who are required to carry federal observers on their vessels and pay their salaries. This requirement, he argues, is excessively costly, consuming up to 20% of their annual returns, far exceeding the caps set by Congress.</p>
<p>Clement criticizes the lower court's deference to the agency's decision, which he views as an overreach of authority, particularly since the statute does not explicitly address who should bear the monitoring costs. He advocates for a de novo review of the statute, focusing on the best interpretation rather than searching for ambiguity.</p>
<p>Additionally, he challenges the Chevron doctrine's methodology, arguing it deserves less deference under the principles of stare decisis. He contends the doctrine is unworkable due to its vague threshold question of ambiguity and destabilizes reliance by enabling agency inconsistencies. Clement concludes by urging the replacement of the Chevron two-step with a singular focus on determining the best reading of the statute.</p>
<p>The respondent's attorney, General Prelogar, counters that the petitioner's characterization of the case as a fundamental question of separation of powers is too broad. She argues that the petitioner has conceded that Congress can delegate authority to define statutory terms and fill gaps, and that there is no constitutional distinction between express and implied delegations of authority. She suggests that the debate is not about the constitutionality of Chevron, but about whether it correctly identifies when a delegation has occurred. She also argues that the practical concerns about Chevron can be managed without overturning it, and that stare decisis should be respected.  </p>
<h3>REBUTTAL</h3>
<p>The petitioner's attorney, Mr. Clement, argues that the NMFS's rule is problematic because it is based on an implied delegation of authority, which he believes is not as clear or limited as an express delegation. He criticizes the Chevron decision for delegating interpretive authority and for not distinguishing between different types of statutory ambiguity. He suggests that traditional statutory interpretation is a better approach. He also argues that Chevron was a mistake and should be revisited, and that expertise does not necessarily require deference to the agency. He concludes by arguing that the Chevron doctrine cannot be modified without overruling Brand X, and that the Court should simply ask how the statute is best read.</p>
<h3>THOMAS</h3>
<p><strong>1. Justice Thomas takes interest in the following issues:<br/></strong>   - The use of mandamus as a basis for deference.<br/>
              - The role of Congress in limiting remedies.<br/>
              - The separation of powers, particularly in relation to statutory interpretation and the role of the courts.<br/>
              - The implications of the Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council decision on these matters.</p>
<p>2. Justice Thomas asks Mr. Clement to comment on the government's argument regarding the use of mandamus as a basis for deference. Mr. Clement responds by distinguishing between the limitation of remedies by Congress and the deference to statutory interpretation by the courts. He argues that while Congress can limit remedies, it is different from telling the courts to defer their interpretation of the law. He further criticizes the Chevron decision, arguing that it wrongly gives interpretive authority to the executive branch, which should only have implementing authority.</p>
<p>3. Justice Thomas's sentiment towards each issue seems to be one of skepticism towards the government's argument for deference based on mandamus. He appears to be interested in the separation of powers and the role of the courts in interpreting the law, suggesting a possible disagreement with the Chevron decision.</p>
<p>4. Justice Thomas's sentiment towards each party's position is not explicitly stated. However, his question to Mr. Clement suggests that he may be skeptical of the government's argument for deference based on mandamus. His interest in Mr. Clement's critique of the Chevron decision may also suggest a potential agreement with Mr. Clement's position that the decision was wrong.  </p>

<p><strong>2. Summary of Justice Sotomayor's questions and the attorneys' responses:<br/></strong>   - To Mr. Clement, Justice Sotomayor questioned the distinction between recognizing discretion and recognizing delegation, and the potential for change in circumstances that may affect the interpretation of statutory terms. Mr. Clement argued that Chevron fails to distinguish between these two concepts and that certain statutory terms have a binary interpretation.<br/>
              - To General Prelogar, Justice Sotomayor asked why Chevron did not address Section 706 of the APA and how to respond to Mr. Clement's interpretation of the statute. General Prelogar argued that Section 706 has never been understood to dictate a de novo standard of review for all statutory interpretation questions, and that there is no inherent tension between Section 706 and Chevron.</p>
<p><strong>3. Analysis of Justice Sotomayor's sentiment towards each issue:<br/></strong>   - Justice Sotomayor seems to be skeptical of the argument that Chevron should be overruled or clarified. She appears to believe that the Act does authorize the NMFS to promulgate the funding rule and that Chevron provides a useful framework for interpreting statutory ambiguity.<br/>

He also suggested that the Chevron experiment has failed.<br/>
              - To General Prelogar, Justice Roberts asked about the application of Chevron to constitutional questions. General Prelogar clarified that Chevron only applies to statutory interpretation and not to constitutional questions. She also defended the Chevron doctrine, arguing that it reflects Congress's intent and is useful in situations of genuine ambiguity.</p>

He also suggested that the Chevron doctrine has led to a lack of legislative action on major societal issues.<br/>
              - To General Prelogar, Justice Kagan asked about the concept of "Kisorizing" Chevron. General Prelogar suggested that the court could reinforce the rigor of the step 1 analysis, emphasize that the enterprise only gets off the ground in a me-type situation, and look at any other statutory indication that Chevron deference was not meant to apply.</p>
<p><strong>3. Analysis of Justice Kagan's sentiment towards each issue:<br/></strong>   - Justice Kagan appears to support the Chevron doctrine, arguing that it is a doctrine of humility that recognizes the expertise of agencies in areas where congressional direction is unclear. She also emphasizes the importance of stare decisis and the potential impact of reversing the Chevron doctrine on existing court decisions.<br/>
              - Regarding the concept of "Kisorizing" Chevron, Justice Kagan seems open to the idea and seeks clarification on what it would entail.</p>

              - To General Prelogar, Justice Barrett asked about the relationship between Brand X and the proposal to "Kisorize" Chevron. General Prelogar argued that Brand X only applies when Chevron deference is granted under step two, and that overruling Chevron would not resolve the inherent indeterminacy in interpreting ambiguous terms.</p>
<p><strong>3. Analysis of the Justice's sentiment towards each issue:<br/></strong>   - Stare decisis: Justice Barrett seems concerned about the potential disruptive consequences of overruling stare decisis, indicating a cautious approach towards changing established legal principles.<br/>
